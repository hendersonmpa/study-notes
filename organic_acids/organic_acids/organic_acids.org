  - methylmalonic

** Why are they measured in urine?

- not extensively reabsorbed in the kidney tubules after glomerular
  filtration
  - can be present at 100x concentration in blood
- readily available sample type
- less invasive than serum
- Over 500 organic acids have been identified in urine.
  - a clinical metabolomics test

* Why is Urine Organic Acid Analysis Requested

** Clinical Indications for UOA analysis

- Neonatal or late-onset acute illness associated with:
  - hyperammonemia
  - hypoglycemia, and/or ketolactic acidosis
  - neurologic abnormalities
    - seizures
    - ataxia
    - hypotonia
    - lethargy
    - coma
    - developmental delay
    - unexplained intellectual disability
  - failure to thrive
  - pancreatitis
  - unexplained metabolic acidosis
  - unusual odor
  - macrocephaly
  - liver failure
- Some symptoms, including lethargy and acidosis, can be due to exogenous intoxication
  - ethylene glycol poisoning
  - ibuprofen overdose
  - \gamma-hydroxybutyric acid

** Reasons for Abnormal Urine Organic Acids profiles
- Elevated concentration of normal metabolites
  - fumaric acid in fumarase deficiency
  - adipic, suberic, and sebacic acids in MCADD
  - ketones in fasting
    - 3-hydroxybutyric
    - acetoacetic

- Pathological metabolites
  - succinylacetone, methylcitric acid

- Food, medications, environment
  - ethosuximide
  - adipic acid
  - cresol
  - 2-furaldehyde

** Naturopathic Medicine

- labs provide the urine organic acid testing 
  - Great Plains Laboratory - OAT
  - Genova Diagnostics - Organix
  - Analytical Reference Laboratories - Urinary Organic Acids

  - Targeted to Naturopaths and  "Functional Medicine"
  - Provide impressive graphical reportes with recomendations for diet and supplements

* Examples

** Case 1

- A 2-week-old female is referred to metabolic clinic following positive newborn screen.
- 3 OH Glutaric acid = 121 mmol/mol UCR, RI <1

** Case 1 UOA

[[./organic_acids/figures/case1uoa.png]]

\pause

- Elevated glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid is consistent with
  Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (GA-1).

** Case 2

- 5 day old girl, with C3 acylcarnitine positive newborn screen.
- MMA = 357 mmol/mol UCR, RI <10 


** Case 2 UOA

[[./organic_acids/figures/case2uoa.png]]

\pause

- Significant elevation in methylmalonic acid, with the presence of
  methylcitric acid is consistent with methlymalonic acidemia
  and cobalamin metabolism defects.

** Case 3

- - a 5 yo female who had come to the ED twice in the last year with
  vomiting, dehydration and hypoglycemia.

- urine organic acids elevation in alpha-ketoacids 
  - 2-ketoisocaproic
  - 2-ketoisovaleric
  - 2-keto-3-methylvaleric
  - urine creatinine = 4,113 umol/L


** Case 3 UOA

[[./organic_acids/figures/fasting.png]]

\pause

- Elevation in alpha-keto acids: 2-ketoisocaproic, 2-ketoisovaleric
  and 2-keto-3-methylvaleric acids,
- These intermediate metabolites of branched chain amino acid
  metabolism can be elevate in fasting and maple syrup urine
  disease.
