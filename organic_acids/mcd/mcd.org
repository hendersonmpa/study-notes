** Causes of Multiple Carboxylase Deficiency
- Biotin Deficiency
- Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency
- Biotinidase Deficiency

** Holocarboxylase Synthetase 
- HCS activates biotin to D-biotin-5'-adenylate
- catalyzes attachment to an apocarboxylase
  - lysine \epsilon{}-amino group

** Holocarboxylase Synthetase Deficiency
- Increased Km for Biotin
  - Normally 1-6 nmol/L, patients 9-12 nmol/L

** Treatment
- All symptoms and biochemical abnormalities treated with biotin.
  - Except optic and auditory nerve atrophy
  - Biocytin?

* Biotinidase Deficiency

** Clinical
- neurologic abnormalities including:
- seizures, hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, vision problems, hearing
 loss, and cutaneous abnormalities (e.g., alopecia, skin rash,
 candidiasis).
- Older children and adolescents with profound biotinidase deficiency
  often exhibit motor limb weakness, spastic paresis, and decreased
  visual acuity.
- Once vision problems, hearing loss, and developmental
  delay occur, they are usually irreversible,

- Autosomal recessively inherited disorder of biotin recycling
  - associated with secondary alterations in amino acid, carbohydrate,
    and fatty acid metabolism.
- Caused by absent or markedly deficient activity of biotinidase
  - cytosolic enzyme that liberates biotin from biocytin during the
    normal proteolytic turnover of holocarboxylases and other
    biotiny-lated proteins.

- Based on newborn screening outcome data from 2006, the incidence of
  profound biotinidase deficiency in the United States is estimated at
  1/80,000 births
- partial biotinidase deficiency between 1/31,000 and 1/40,000


** Diagnostic Testing
- Diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency is based on demonstrating
  deficient enzyme activity in serum or plasma

- Patients with profound biotinidase deficiency have less than 10% of
  mean normal serum activity

- Patients with the partial biotinidase deficiency variant have 10-30%
  of mean normal serum activity
  - are largely asymptomatic

- Confirmation of biotinidase deficiency by DNA analysis, by either
  allele-targeted methods or full-gene sequencing, may be useful.

** Biotinidase

- Biotinidase is a monomeric enzyme encoded by a single gene (BTD) located on chromosome 3p25
  - comprises 543 amino acid residues, including 41 amino acids of a potential signal peptide.

- Three publicly available databases of biotinidase variants:
  - [[https://grenada.lumc.nl/LOVD2/shared1/home.php?select_db=BTD][Leiden Open Variation Database]]
  - [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/][ClinVar]]
  - [[http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/BTD/BTD_welcome.php][ARUP:Biotinidase Deficiency and BTD]]

- 204 biotinidase variants are consolidated in the ARUP database,
  - >150 categorized as pathogenic
  - 145 missense changes
  - Four common pathogenic variants cause profound biotinidase deficiency.

** Pathogenic Variants
- Among children ascertained because of clinical symptoms, the two
  most commonly reported variants are:

  - c.98_104delinsTCC in exon 2
    - seven-base deletion/three-base insertion
    - occurring in at least one allele in approximately 50% of affected individuals

  - p.Arg538Cys in exon 4
    - occurring at least once in 30% of affected individuals

  - These variants result in complete absence of biotinidase protein. 

- Other relatively common variants discovered by newborn screening are:
  - p.Gln456His, associated with profound deficiency

  - p.Asp444His, a substitution that reduces enzymatic activity by about 50%.

  - The p.Asp444His variant in trans with a severe BTD pathogenic variant is associated with partial biotinidase deficiency,
  - p.Asp444His in cis with p.Ala171Thr (i.e., as the double mutant p.[(Ala171Thr); (Asp444His)]), results in a profound biotinidase deficiency allele.


** Partial & Profound Deficiency

*** Profound Deficiency
- Initially, most symptomatic children with biotinidase deficiency were found to have 3% of mean serum biotinidase activity of normal individuals.
- Three standard deviations above this mean, corresponding to 10% of mean normal activity, was taken as the threshold below which individuals were considered to have profound biotinidase deficiency.

*** Partial Deficiency
- With NBS for biotinidase deficiency babies were identified with about 25% of mean normal activity.
- Essentially all of these children had the p.Asp444His variant as one of their alleles
- This variant, together with a variant for profound deficiency on the other allele, results in 10â€“30% of mean normal biotinidase activity.
- These children are considered to have partial biotinidase deficiency.


** NBS for partial deficiency

- A retrospective study reviewing clinical histories of
  individuals with profound (22) or partial (120) biotinidase
  deficiency identified by newborn screening supports the long-term
  benefit of treatment and management of both populations. [fn:biot]
