#+TITLE: Methylmalonic Acidemia
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
** History
- First reported in 1967 by Oberholzer and Stokke
- Defect in methylmalonic mutase
  - catalyzes the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA
- Requires adenosylcobalamin as a cofactor
  - derived from vitamin B_12
- Genetic heterogeneity was observed early
  - response to large doses of B_12
- B_12 responsive have defects in adenosylcobalamin synthesis
- B_12 unresponsive have defects in the apoenzyme methylmalonyl mutase
  - mut^- :: little activity
  - mut^0 :: no activity

** Methylmalonyl CoA Mutase
- Upon entry to the mitochondria, the 32 amino acid mitochondrial
  leader sequence at the N-terminus of the protein is cleaved, forming
  the fully processed monomer.
- The monomers associate into homodimers, and bind AdoCbl (one
  for each monomer active site) to form the active holoenzyme

** Methylmalonyl-CoA

- inhibits PCC \to \uparrow PA
*** Hyperglycinemia
- inhibits synthesis of glycine cleaving enzyme.
- inhibits transport of malate, 2-ketoglutarate and isocitrate
*** CBC
- megaloblastosis in cblC defects
  - \downarrow methylcobalamin

*** Hyperammonemia
- PA inhibits carbamylphosphate synthetase
*** Ketosis
- PA inhibits mitochondrial oxidation of succinic acid and 2-ketoglutaric acid

** Long-term Treatment
*** Diet
- Limit Val, Ile, Thr, Met
  - Monitor urine metabolites, plasma amino acids
