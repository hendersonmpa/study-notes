#+TITLE: Disorders of Isoprenoid/Cholesterol Synthesis
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- isoprenoids function in a variety of cellular processes including
  - cell growth and differentiation, protein glycosylation, signal
    transduction pathways
- isoprenoid synthesis starts from acetyl-CoA (Figures [[fig:chol2]])
  - converted in 6 steps to isopentenyl-PP
  - isopentenyl-PP is the basic isoprene unit used for the synthesis
    of subsequent isoprenoids
  - first committed intermediate in sterol isoprenoid synthesis is
    squalene
  - undergoes cyclisation \to lanosterol
  - lanosterol \to cholesterol occurs via two routes (Figures [[fig:chol]])
    - depending on the timing of reduction of the \Delta^24 double bond
    - involve the same enzymes
    - penulimate product is either:
      - 7-dehydrocholesterol
      - desmosterol

* Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- auto-inflammatory metabolic disorder
- onset 1st year of life, often triggered by childhood vaccinations
- lifelong episodes of fever and inflammation triggered by stress
- episodes last 3-7 days, recur on average every 4-6 weeks associated with:
  - abdominal pain
  - vomiting and diarrhoea,
  - (cervical) lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthralgia skin rash
- two recognized forms in a disease spectrum:
  - classic mevalonic aciduria (MKD-MA) - severe
  - hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome (MKD-HIDS) - mild

- MKD-MA patients can present with additional congenital anomalies
  such as:
  - mental retardation, ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, severe
    FTT, dysmorphic features, high risk of death in early infancy
    
** Metabolic Derangement
- *mevalonate kinase* deficiency (Figure [[fig:chol2]])
\ce{mevalonate + ATP ->[MK] 5-phosphomevalonate + ADP}
- synthesis of all isoprenoids will be affected
- clinical presentation \propto residual MK activity
  - activity < LOD in MKD-MA
  - 1-10% in MKD-HIDS

** Genetics
- AR, MVK
- most patients are compound heterozygotes

** Diagnostic tests
- urine organic acids
  - \uparrow mevalonic acid
    - found in MKD-MA not always MKD-HIDS
  - \uparrow mevalonolactone
- serum
  - \uparrow CK
  - \uparrow IgD
  - \uparrow transaminases
- best diagnostic tests are:
  - WBC or fibroblasts MK activity
  - molecular analysis of MVK

** Treatment and Prognosis
- no treatment
- many MVK-MA die in infancy
- some MVK-HIDS improve with immunosuppression

* Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
** Clinical Presentation
- spectrum of morphogenic and congenital anomalies
- clinical and biochemical continuum ranging from hardly recognizable
  to very severe (lethal in utero)
- most affected patients have a characteristic craniofacial appearance
- cutaneous syndactyly of the second and third toes (>97% of cases)
- genital abnormalities may include hypospadias, cryptorchidism and
  ambiguous male genitalia
- congenital heart defects, renal, adrenal, lung and gastrointestinal
  anomalies

** Metabolic Derangement
- *7-dehydrocholesterol reductase* deficiency (Figure [[fig:chol2]])
  - catalyses the predominant final step in cholesterol biosynthesis
    - reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol(DHC) C7-C8 double bond \to cholesterol

** Genetics
- AR DHCR7 1:15,000-60,000
- *most frequent cholesterol biosynthesis defect*

** Diagnostic Tests
- sterol analysis of plasma or tissues of patients by GC-MS
  - \uparrow 7-DHC and 8-DHC are diagnostic
- \downarrow-N plasma cholesterol

** Treatment and Prognosis
- most anomalies occurring in SLOS are due to the unavailability of
  sufficient cholesterol during early embryonic development
  - \therefore postnatal therapy not feasible
- sterol supplementation tried w disappointing results
