#+TITLE: Disorders of Isoprenoid/Cholesterol Synthesis
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- Isoprenoids function in a variety of cellular processes including:
  - cell growth and differentiation, protein glycosylation, signal
    transduction pathways
- Isoprenoid synthesis starts from acetyl-CoA
  - in six enzyme reactions is converted into isopentenyl-PP
  - the basic isoprene unit used for the synthesis of subsequent
    isoprenoids
- first committed intermediate in sterol isoprenoid synthesis is
  squalene
- cyclisation \to lanosterol
- lanosterol \to cholesterol may occur via two major routes involving
  the same enzymes
- depending on the timing of reduction of the \Delta^24 double bond either:
  - 7-dehydrocholesterol
  - desmosterol

* Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- autoinflammatory metabolic disorder
- onset 1st year of life, often triggered by childhood vaccinations
- lifelong episodes of fever and inflammation triggered by stress
- episodes last 3–7 days, recur on average every 4–6 weeks associated with:
  - abdominal pain
  - vomiting and diarrhoea,
  - (cervical) lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthralgia skin rash
- Two recognized forms in a disease spectrum:
  - classic mevalonic aciduria (MKD-MA) - severe
  - hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome (MKD-HIDS) - mild

- MKD-MA patients can present with additional congenital anomalies
  such as:
  - mental retardation, ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, severe
    FTT, dysmorphic features, high risk of death in early infancy

** Metabolic Derangement
- clinical presentation \propto residual MK activity
  - activity < LOD in MKD-MA
  - 1-10% in MKD-HIDS
\ce{mevalonate + ATP ->[MK] 5-phosphomevalonate + ADP}
- synthesis of all isoprenoids will be affected

** Genetics
- AR, MVK
- most patients are compound heterozygotes

** Diagnostic tests
- \uparrow mevalonic acid in urine organic acids
  - present in MKD-MA not always MKD-HIDS
- best diagnostic tests are:
  - WBC or fibroblasts MK activity
  - molecular analysis of MVK

** Treatment and Prognosis
- no treatment
- many MVK-MA die in infancy
- some MVK-HIDS improve with immunosuppression

* Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
** Clinical Presentation
- large and variable spectrum of morphogenic and congenital anomalies
- clinical and biochemical continuum ranging from hardly recognisable
  to very severe (lethal in utero)
- Most affected patients have a characteristic craniofacial appearance
- cutaneous syndactyly of the second and third toes (>97% of cases)
- Genital abnormalities may include hypospadias cryptorchidism and ambiguous
- congenital heart defects, and renal, adrenal, lung and
  gastrointestinal anomalies

** Metabolic Derangement
- 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase deficiency
  - catalyses the predominant final step in cholesterol biosynthesis
  - reduce 7-dehydrocholesterol C7-C8 double bond \to cholesterol

** Genetics
- AR, DHCR7, 1:15000-60000
- Most frequency cholesterol biosynthesis defect

** Diagnostic Tests
- sterol analysis of plasma or tissues of patients by GC-MS,
  - \uparrow 7-dehydrocholesterol and 8-dehydrocholesterol are diagnostic
- plasma cholesterol is usually low or low normal

** Treatment and Prognosis
- most anomalies occurring in SLOS are assumed to be due to the
  unavailability of sufficient cholesterol during (early) embryonic
  development
- it will most probably not be feasible to develop a postnatal therapy
- sterol supplementation used, disappointing results
