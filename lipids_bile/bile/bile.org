* Introduction

- Bile acids are biological detergents synthesised from cholesterol
  in the liver by modifications of the sterol nucleus and oxidation of
  the side chain
- Synthesis of bile acids can occur by a number of pathways
  - adults starts with conversion of cholesterol to 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol
  - infants other pathways are more important
  - one starts with the conversion of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol
- Two IEMs affect the modifications of cholesterol nucleus in both pathways:
  1. 3\beta-hydroxy-\Delta^5-C_{27}-steroid dehydrogenase (3\beta-dehydrogenase) deficiency
  2. \Delta4-3-oxosteroid 5\beta-reductase (5\beta-reductase) deficiency
- These disorders \to cholestatic liver disease and malabsorption of
  fat and fat-soluble vitamins
- Onset of symptoms ~ 1st year of life
- untreated, the liver disease can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure
- Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid
  - dramatic improvement in liver disease and malabsorption

- Two disorders affecting oxidation of the cholesterol side chain:
  - sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis [CTX])
  - \alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency
- can present with neonatal cholestatic liver disease
- commonly present later with neurological disease
- Chenodeoxycholic acid has been shown to halt or even reverse
  neurological dysfunction in CTX
- Theses disorders are part of a growing list of defects that may
  present with transient neonatal cholestatic jaundice followed by a
  late onset neurodegenerative disorder
- likely that the 27-hydroxycholesterol pathway is important in
  fuelling bile flow in infancy and in the production and metabolism
  of important oxysterols in the brain later in life
- Other inborn errors of bile acid synthesis include:
  - two bile acid amidation defects
    - cholestatic liver disease and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption
    - cholesterol 7\alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (adults with hyperlipidaemia and gallstones)
- In disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and peroxisomal
  \beta-oxidation, neurological disease usually predominates
- A disorder affecting peroxisomal import of CoA esters of DHCA and
  THCA produces predominantly liver disease

- Most of the known enzyme deficiencies of bile acid synthesis affect
  both the 27-hydroxycholesterol and the 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol pathways
  - exceptions are cholesterol 7\alpha-hydroxylase deficiency and
    oxysterol 7\alpha-hydroxylase deficiency
- Because of the broad specificity of many of the enzymes, the major
  metabolites are often not those immediately proximal to the block
- in 3\beta-hydroxy \Delta^5-C_{27}-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency
  - major metabolite is not 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol
  - \to unsaturated bile acids with normal bile acid side chain but
    persistence of the 3\beta, 7\alpha-dihydroxy-\Delta^5 structure of
    the nucleus

* 3\beta-dehydrogenase deficiency
** Clinical presentation
- present with
  - neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
  - rickets
  - hepatomegaly
  - pruritus
  - steatorrhoea
  - failure to thrive
  - fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption
    - \downarrow 25-OH vitamin D, K and E
    - prolonged prothrombin time

- untreated \to death from complications of cirrhosis before the age
  of 5 years
- patients with milder forms of the disorder may survive, with a
  chronic hepatitis or even remain asymptomatic, into their second
  decade or beyond.



** Metabolic Derangement
- 3\beta-dehydrogenase catalyses the second reaction in the major
  pathway of synthesis of bile acids:
- 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol \to 7\alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one

- accumulating 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol can undergo side-chain
  oxidation with or without 12\alpha-hydroxylation to produce
  - 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid
  - 3\beta,7\alpha,12\alpha-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid
- These unsaturated C_{24} bile acids are sulphated in the C3 position;
  - a proportion is conjugated to glycine
  - can be found in high concentrations in the urine
- probable that the sulphated \Delta^5 bile acids cannot be secreted
  into the bile canaliculi and fuel bile flow in the same way as
  occurs with the normal bile acids
  - they probably inhibit bile acid-dependent bile flow
- two possible ways this \to hepatocyte damage:
  - abnormal toxic metabolites 
  - failure of bile acid-dependent bile flow

** Genetics
- AR, HSD3B7

** Diagnostic Tests
- characteristic plasma or urine bile acids with a
  - \Delta^5 double bond
  - 3\beta-hydroxyl/sulphate group
  - 7\alpha-hydroxyl group
- bile acids with a \Delta^5 double bond and a 7-hydroxy group are acid labile.
- FAB-MS or ESI-MS/MS analysis overcomes this problem

*** Plasma
- profile of non-sulphated bile acids by FAB-MS,ESI-MS/MS,(GC-MS w/o solvolysis): 
  - \Downarrow cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid for an infant with cholestasis
  - \uparrow 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid
- FAB-MS,ESI-MS/MS,(GC-MS w solvolysis):
  - \uparrow 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid (3-sulphate)
  - 3\beta,7\alpha,12\alpha-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid (3-sulphate)

*** Urine
- negative ion FAB-MS or ESI-MS shows the characteristic ions of the
  diagnostic
  - unsaturated bile acids
  - sulphated \Delta^5 bile acids
  - glycine conjugates of sulphated \Delta^5 bile acids

*** Fibroblasts
- \downarrow 3\beta-Dehydrogenase activity cultured skin fibroblasts using
  tritiated 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol


** Treatment and Prognosis
- Emergency treatment of coagulopathy with parenteral vitamin K may be required
- long term bile acid replacement therapy corrects all the fat-soluble
  vitamin deficiencies

- cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid therapy \to improvement in symptoms

* 5\beta-reductase deficiency
- excrete 3-oxo-\Delta^4 bile acids as the major urinary bile acids
  - \uparrow 7\alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid glycine conjugate
  - \uparrow 7\alpha,12\alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholenoic acid glycine conjugate
- 8 patients
- treat w chenodeoxycholic acid plus cholic acid
* Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis 
** Clinical Presentation
- average age of diagnosis is 35 years w a diagnostic delay of 16 years
- described as a paediatric disease diagnosed in adulthood
- signs and symptoms includ:
  - adult-onset progressive neurological dysfunction
  - non-neurologic manifestations
    - tendon xanthomas
    - premature atherosclerosis
    - osteoporosis
    - respiratory insufficiency

** Metabolic Derangement
- sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency
- mitochondrial catalyses first step inside-chain oxidation.
  - required to convert a C27 sterol into a C24 bile acid
- 5\beta-cholestane-3\alpha,7\alpha,12\alpha-triol cannot be hydroxylated in the C_{27}
  position and accumulates in the liver
  - products of secondary reactions also accumulate
  - converted to cholestanol
- reduced rate of bile-acid synthesis
  - \therefore the normal feedback inhibition of cholesterol
    7\alpha-hydroxylase by bile acids is disrupted
- symptoms partly due to accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol
- lack of 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid may contribute to motor
  neuron damage

** Genetics
- AR, CYP27A1

** Diagnostic Tests
- molecular
*** Plasma
- \uparrow cholestanol by GC or HPLC
- \uparrow cholestanol/cholesterol ratio
- \downarrow 7-hydroxycholesterol
*** Urine
- major cholanoids are cholestanepentol glucuronides by FAB-MS or ESI-MS/MS

** Treatment and Prognosis
- Chenodeoxycholic acid
* \alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency

** Clinical Presentation
- neurological problems start from childhood to late adult life and
  include:
  - mental delay, cognitive decline 
  - acute encephalopathy
  - tremor, ataxia
  - pigmentary retinopathy
  - hemiparesis, spastic paraparesis, peripheral neuropathy
  - depression, headache

** Metabolic Derangement
- side-chain oxidation of cholesterol produces:
  - 25R isomer of 3\alpha,7\alpha,12\alpha-trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA [(25R)-THC-CoA]
- \alpha-oxidation of dietary phytanic acid produces (some):
  - (2R)-pristanoyl-CoA
- these need to be converted to the S-isomers by AMACR before they can
  undergo peroxisomal \beta-oxidation 

** Genetics
- AR, AMACR

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow plasma DHCA and THCA by GC-MS
- \uparrow pristanic acid
- \uparrow/n plasma phytanic acid
- normal VLFCA

** Treatment and Prognosis
- cholic acid
- phytanic acid
