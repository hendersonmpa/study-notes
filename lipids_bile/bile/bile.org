#+TITLE: Disorders of Bile Acid Synthesis
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- bile acids are biological detergents synthesised from cholesterol
  in the liver by modifications of the sterol nucleus and oxidation of
  the side chain
- the first reaction (7\alpha-hydroxylation) is rate limiting
  - some steps involve peroxisomal \beta-oxidation
- the two main bile acids cholic and chenodeoxycholic
  - are activated to CoA esters
  - conjugated with either glycine or taurine to form bile salts
  - excreted in bile
- bile acids are essential for lipid resorption in the gut
  - regulate hepatic cholesterol synthesis via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
- synthesis can occur by a number of pathways
  - adults starts with conversion of cholesterol to 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol
  - infants other pathways are more important
    - one starts with the conversion of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol
- because of the broad specificity of many of the enzymes, the major
  metabolites are often not those immediately proximal to the block

* 3\beta-dehydrogenase deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- present in childhood with
  - neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
  - rickets
  - hepatomegaly
  - pruritus
  - steatorrhoea
  - failure to thrive
  - fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption
    - \downarrow 25-OH vitamin D, K and E
    - prolonged prothrombin time

- untreated \to death from complications of cirrhosis before the age
  of 5 years
- patients with milder forms of the disorder may survive, with a
  chronic hepatitis or even remain asymptomatic, into their second
  decade or beyond.
** Metabolic Derangement
- 3\beta-dehydrogenase catalyses the second reaction in the major
  pathway of synthesis of bile acid (Figure [[fig:bile]], enzyme 2)
- 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol \to 7\alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one
- accumulating 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol can undergo side-chain
  oxidation with or without 12\alpha-hydroxylation to produce
  - 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid
  - 3\beta,7\alpha,12\alpha-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid
- these unsaturated C_{24} bile acids are sulphated in the C3 position
  - a proportion is conjugated to glycine
  - high concentrations in the urine
- sulphated \Delta^5 bile acids cannot be secreted into the bile
  canaliculi and fuel bile flow in the same way as occurs with the
  normal bile acids
  - inhibits bile acid-dependent bile flow \to hepatocyte damage:
    1) abnormal toxic metabolites 
    2) failure of bile acid-dependent bile flow

** Genetics
- AR, HSD3B7

** Diagnostic Tests
- characteristic plasma or urine bile acids with
  - \Delta^5 double bond
  - 3\beta-hydroxyl/sulphate group
  - 7\alpha-hydroxyl group
- bile acids with a \Delta^5 double bond and a 7-hydroxy group are acid labile
- FAB-MS or ESI-MS/MS analysis overcomes this problem

*** Plasma
- profile of non-sulphated bile acids by FAB-MS, ESI-MS/MS, GC-MS w/o solvolysis:
  - \Downarrow cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid for an infant with cholestasis
  - \uparrow 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid
- FAB-MS, ESI-MS/MS, GC-MS w solvolysis:
  - \uparrow 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid (3-sulphate)
  - 3\beta,7\alpha,12\alpha-trihydroxy-5-cholenoic acid (3-sulphate)

*** Urine
- negative ion FAB-MS or ESI-MS shows diagnostic
  - unsaturated bile acids
  - sulphated \Delta^5 bile acids
  - glycine conjugates of sulphated \Delta^5 bile acids

*** Fibroblasts
- \downarrow 3\beta-Dehydrogenase activity cultured skin fibroblasts using
  tritiated 7\alpha-hydroxycholesterol

** Treatment and Prognosis
- emergency treatment of coagulopathy with parenteral vitamin K may be required
- long term bile acid replacement therapy corrects all the fat-soluble
  vitamin deficiencies

- cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid therapy \to improvement in symptoms

* 5\beta-reductase deficiency
- 5\beta-reductase deficiency (Figure [[fig:bile]], enzyme 3)
- excrete 3-oxo-\Delta^4 bile acids as the major urinary bile acids
  - \uparrow 7\alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid glycine conjugate
  - \uparrow 7\alpha,12\alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholenoic acid glycine conjugate
- 8 patients
- treat w chenodeoxycholic acid plus cholic acid
* Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis 
** Clinical Presentation
- average age of diagnosis is 35 years w a diagnostic delay of 16 years
  - described as a pediatric disease diagnosed in adulthood
- signs and symptoms include:
  - adult-onset progressive neurological dysfunction
  - non-neurologic manifestations
    - tendon xanthomas
    - premature atherosclerosis
    - osteoporosis
    - respiratory insufficiency

** Metabolic Derangement
- sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency (Figure [[fig:bile]], enzyme 4)
- mitochondrial enzyme catalyses first step inside-chain oxidation
  - required to convert a C27 sterol into a C24 bile acid
- 5\beta-cholestane-3\alpha,7\alpha,12\alpha-triol cannot be hydroxylated in the C_{27}
  position and accumulates in the liver
  - products of secondary reactions also accumulate
  - converted to cholestanol
- reduced rate of bile-acid synthesis
  - \therefore the normal feedback inhibition of cholesterol
    7\alpha-hydroxylase by bile acids is disrupted (Figure [[fig:bile]], enzyme 1)
- symptoms partly due to accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol
- lack of 3\beta,7\alpha-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid may contribute to motor
  neuron damage

** Genetics
- AR, CYP27A1

** Diagnostic Tests
- molecular
*** Plasma
- \uparrow cholestanol by GC or HPLC
- \uparrow cholestanol/cholesterol ratio
- \downarrow 7-hydroxycholesterol
*** Urine
- major cholanoids are cholestanepentol glucuronides by FAB-MS or ESI-MS/MS

** Treatment and Prognosis
- chenodeoxycholic acid
- statins
* \alpha-Methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency

** Clinical Presentation
- neurological problems start from childhood to late adult life and
  include:
  - mental delay, cognitive decline 
  - acute encephalopathy
  - tremor, ataxia
  - pigmentary retinopathy
  - hemiparesis, spastic paraparesis, peripheral neuropathy
  - depression, headache

** Metabolic Derangement
- \alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency (Figure [[fig:bile]], enzyme 5)
- side-chain oxidation of cholesterol produces:
  - 25R isomer of 3\alpha,7\alpha,12\alpha-trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA [(25R)-THC-CoA]
- \alpha-oxidation of dietary phytanic acid produces (some):
  - (2R)-pristanoyl-CoA
- these must be converted to their S-isomers by AMACR before they can
  undergo peroxisomal \beta-oxidation

** Genetics
- AR, AMACR

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow plasma DHCA and THCA by GC-MS
- \uparrow pristanic acid
- \uparrow/n plasma phytanic acid
- normal VLFCA

** Treatment and Prognosis
- vitamin K
- cholic acid
- phytanic acid
