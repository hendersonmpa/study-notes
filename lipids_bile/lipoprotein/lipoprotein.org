#+TITLE: Inborn Errors of Lipoprotein Metabolism
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- VLDL are large particles produced in the liver
  - transport endogenously synthesized TG and cholesterol to the peripheral tissue
- IDL are created with the metabolism of VLDL by lipoprotein lipase
  - may be removed by the liver or converted LDL by hepatic triglyceride lipase
** LDL
- LDL contain ~45% cholesterol and they are the major carrier of
  cholesterol to peripheral tissues
- LDL particles are heterogeneous
  - small dense LDL particles have been associated with increased risk
    for cardiovascular disease
  - \uparrow small dense LDL associated with male gender and diabetes in adults
- LDL is recognized by specific LDL receptors
  - highly expressed in the liver
- once bound to receptor are internalized into the cell
- removes ~75% LDL particles
- remaining LDL are removed by macrophages
** HDL
- HDL are produced by the liver and the gastrointestinal tract, and
  peripheral catabolism of chylomicrons and VLDL particles
- HDL particles are also heterogeneous
  - HDL2 is associated with protection from atherosclerosis
  - HDL3 is a smaller particle
    - \uparrow in alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes, cigarette
      smoking, uraemia and hypertriglyceridemia
  - HDL particles are involved in reverse transport of free
    cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver 
** Lp(a)
- Lp(a) has also been found to be associated with the atherosclerotic
  process
- Lp(a) is similar to LDL, but with the addition of a large "little a"
  protein bound to apoB via a single cysteine-mediated disulphide
  bond
- plasma levels are regulated independently from LDL
- \uparrow risk of coronary heart disease if both LDL and Lp(a) are
  elevated
- Lp(a) protein is similar to plasminogen, may inhibit the
  thrombolytic activity of plasminogen \to \uparrow atherosclerosis
- inborn errors of lipoprotein metabolism are a group of genetic
  disorders exemplified by changes in plasma lipids due to defects in:
  - protein lipid-carriers (lipoproteins)
  - lipoprotein receptors
  - enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis and clearance of
    lipoprotein-lipid complexes
- *heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is the most common*
  *inherited lipid disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 500*

* LDL Metabolism
- see table [[tab:lip]]
- atherosclerotic process begins in childhood
- extent and rate of progression has \propto lipid levels
- healthy lifestyles and a lower saturated fat intake is the
  cornerstone of treatment of lipid disorders in children
- lipid-lowering therapies are important

- five genetic disorders
  1) familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) - LDL receptor
     - heterozygous and more severe homozygous forms
  2) familial ligand defective apo-B (FLDB)
  3) autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia
  4) sitosterolemia
  5) proprotein convertase substilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
- \Uparrow risk of premature atherosclerosis
- \Uparrow risk of CAD in adulthood

| Disorder                         | Int      | Protein              | Profile      | Freq         |
|----------------------------------+----------+----------------------+--------------+--------------|
| AD familial hypercholesterolemia | AD       | LDLR (het)           | \uparrow LDL | 1 in 250-500 |
| AR familial hypercholesterolemia | AR       | LDLR (homo/comp het) | \uparrow LDL | 1 in 10^6    |
| AD familial hypercholesterolemia | AD       | PCSK9                | \uparrow LDL |              |
| familial apo-B-100 deficiency    | A semi-D | Apo-B                | \uparrow LDL | 1 in 500     |

** Apolipoprotein B 
- *Apolipoprotein B* deficiency results in
  - \downarrow LDL and triglycerides

- familial abetalipoproteinemia
  - fat malabsorption
  - microsomal triglyceride transfer protein deficiency
  - \downarrow production of apoB containing lipoproteins

- familial hypobetalipoproteinemia
  - milder form of abetalipoproteinemia
  - apoB dysfunction

* Triglyceride Metabolism
- may present early in childhood with faltering growth,
  hepatosplenomegaly and life threatening pancreatitis
- TG \gt 10 mmol/L is rare in children
  - associated with lipoprotein lipase or apoCII defects
  - apoCII activates LPL
  - TG as high as 250 mmol/L possible
  - \to pancreatitis and eruptive xanthomas
- low fat diet (<10% fat)
- glybera - LPL gene therapy 

** Familial Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency 
- Type-I Hyperlipidaemia
- consanguinity 1 in 1 million (homozygous)
- founder effect in French Canadian population in Quebec
  - carrier frequency 1 in 40
* HDL Metabolism
- disorders of HDL are very rare
- Three AR inherited disorders described
  1) *apolipoprotein A-1* deficiency
     - \downarrow HDL early atherosclerosis
  2) Familial Hypoalphalipoproteinaemia (Tangierâ€™s disease)
     - polyneuropathy, hepatosplenomegaly, CC, CAD
  3) *lecithin:cholesterol acyltranferase (LCAT)* Deficiency
     - neuropathy, CC
- \downarrow HDL and apoAI
- \uparrow cholesterol and triglycerides
- premature atherosclerosis

* Sterol Storage
- *lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)* Deficiency is a lysosomal storage
  disorder includes:
  - acute infantile onset form - Wolman disease
    - extreme faltering growth, malabsorption, hepatosplenomegaly,
      adrenal calcification and death in early infancy
  - cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) presenting in childhood/adulthood
    - slow progression w hepatosplenomegaly and microvesicular
      cirrhosis, premature atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolaemia
      (\uparrow LDL-C, \downarrow HDL-C)
- accumulation of cholesteryl ester in the lysosomes is secondary to a
  deficiency of an esterase that is responsible for hydrolysis of
  esterified cholesterol in the normal lysosome
- sebelipase alfa (recombinant LAL) is licensed for Wolman disease and
  CESD
