* Introduction
- VLDL are large particles produced in the liver.
  - transport endogenously synthesized TG and cholesterol to the peripheral tissue
- IDL are created with the metabolism of VLDL by lipoprotein lipase
  - may be removed by the liver or converted LDL by hepatic triglyceride lipase
** LDL
- LDL contain ~45% cholesterol and they are the major carrier of
  cholesterol to peripheral tissues
- LDL particles are heterogeneous:
  - small dense LDL particles have been associated with increased risk
    for cardiovascular disease
  - \uparrow small dense LDL associated with male gender and diabetes in adults
- LDL is recognized by specific LDL receptors
  - highly expressed in the liver
- once bound to receptor are internalized into the cell
- removes ~75% LDL particles
- remaining LDL are removed by macrophages
** HDL
- HDL are produced by the liver and the gastrointestinal tract, and
  peripheral catabolism of chylomicrons and VLDL particles
- HDL particles are also heterogeneous:
  - HDL2 is associated with protection from atherosclerosis
  - HDL3 is a smaller particle
    - \uparrow in alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes, cigarette
      smoking, uraemia and hypertriglyceridemia
  - HDL particles are involved in reverse transport of free
    cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver 
** Lp(a)
- Lp(a) has also been found to be associated with the atherosclerotic
  process
- Lp(a) is similar to LDL, but with the addition of a large "little a"
  protein bound to apoB via a single cysteine-mediated disulphide
  bond
- plasma levels are regulated independently from LDL
- risk of coronary heart disease is \Uparrowcreased if both LDL and
  Lp(a) are elevated
- the (a) protein is similar to plasminogen, may inhibit the
  thrombolytic activity of plasminogen \to \uparrow atherosclerosis
- Inborn errors of lipoprotein metabolism are a group of genetic
  disorders exemplified by changes in plasma lipids due to defects in:
  - the protein lipid-carriers (lipoproteins)
  - lipoprotein receptors
  - enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis and clearance of
    lipoprotein-lipid complexes
- *heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is the most common*
  *inherited lipid disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 500*

* LDL Metabolism Disorders
- atherosclerotic process begins in childhood
- extent and rate of progression has \propto lipid levels
- healthy lifestyles and a lower saturated fat intake is the
  cornerstone of treatment of lipid disorders in children
- lipid-lowering therapies are important

- Five genetic disorders:
  1) familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) - LDL receptor
     - heterozygous and more severe homozygous forms
  2) familial ligand defective apo-B (FLDB)
  3) autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia
  4) sitosterolemia
  5) proprotein convertase substilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
- \Uparrow risk of premature atherosclerosis
- \Uparrow risk of CAD in adulthood

* Triglyceride Metabolism
- may present early in childhood with faltering growth,
  hepatosplenomegaly and life threatening pancreatitis
- TG \gt 10 mmol/L is rare in children
  - associated with lipoprotein lipase or apoCII defects
  - apoCII activates LPL
  - TG as high as 250 mmol/L possible
  - \to pancreatitis and eruptive xanthomas
- low fat diet (<10% fat)
- Glybera - LPL gene therapy 
- Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency - Type-I hyperlipidaemia
  - consanguinity 1 in 1 million (homozygous)
  - founder effect in French Canadian population in Quebec
    - carrier frequency 1 in 40
* HDL Metabolism
- Disorders of HDL are very rare
- 3 AR inherited disorders described:
  1) Apolipoprotein A-1 deficiency
  2) familial hypoalphalipoproteinaemia (Tangierâ€™s disease)
  3) lecithin:cholesterol acyltranferase (LCAT) deficiency
- \downarrow HDL and Apo A-I
- \uparrow cholesterol and triglycerides
- premature atherosclerosis
* Sterol Storage
- Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency is a lysosomal storage
  disorder includes:
  - acute infantile onset form - Wolman disease
    - extreme faltering growth, malabsorption, hepatosplenomegaly,
      adrenal calcification and death in early infancy
  - cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) presenting in childhood/adulthood
    - slow progression w hepatosplenomegaly and microvesicular
      cirrhosis, premature atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolaemia
      (\uparrow LDL-C, \downarrow HDL-C)
- accumulation of cholesteryl ester in the lysosomes is secondary to a
  deficiency of an esterase that is responsible for hydrolysis of
  esterified cholesterol in the normal lysosome
- Sebelipase alfa (recombinant LAL) is licensed for Wolman disease and
  CESD
