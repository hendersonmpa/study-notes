* Introduction
- acylglycerols and phospholipids (PL) play many organ-specific roles
  in cell structure, biochemistry and signalling
- PLs form the bilayer of cell membranes
  - a phosphate group that constitutes a hydrophilic head, located on the surface of the bilayer
  - a fatty acid chain that forms a hydrophobic tail, located inside
- TGs are extremely hydrophobic, and form droplets
  that are surrounded by a PL monolayer
- the first steps of TG and of PL synthesis are the same (Figure [[fig:tg]])
- /de novo/ synthesis begins from glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), which is
  formed from glycerol or from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)
  - DHAP is an intermediate of both glycolysis and of gluconeogenesis
- G3P is esterified by:
  1) glycerolphosphate acyltransferases (GPATs) to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
  2) acylglycerol acyltransferases (AGPATs) to form phosphatidic acid (PA)
- PA can either be converted into
  - diacylglycerol (DG) by phosphatidic acid phosphatases or
  - CDP-diacylglycerol by phosphatidic acid cytidyltransferase (CDP-DAG synthase)
- DG is an essential intermediate for synthesis of TGs and three major PLs:
  1) phosphatidyl choline
  2) phosphatidyl ethanolamine
  3) phosphatidyl serine


- inborn errors of glycerolipid metabolism cause a vast array of
  clinical phenotypes
- molecular analysis is currently the principal diagnostic
  technique
- NGS \to discovery of several genetic defects of the biosynthesis and
  remodelling of triglycerides (TGs), other acyl-glycerols and of PLs
- few disorders of glycerolipid metabolism have distinct metabolite
  patterns by conventional techniques
- some of these conditions produce striking clinical syndromes
  identifiable in infancy
- others are mildly atypical forms of common adult conditions like:
  - metabolic syndrome
  - type II diabetes

* Common Pathway
** Lipin-1 Deficiency 
- recurrent childhood rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria
- accounts for ~10% of patients with severe recurrent childhood
  rhabdomyolysis
  - occurring particularly between 2â€“6 years of age
  - CK \gt 10,000 after excercise
- *phosphatidic acid phosphatases* (PAPs, LPIN1-3) deficiency
  - catalyse phosphate removal, the first dedicated step of TG
    synthesis, creating a diacylglycerol

* TG Biosynthesis and Lipolysis 
- extremely rare
- inborn errors of intracellular TG metabolism often affect adipose
  tissue, but non-adipose signs can dominate their clinical
  presentation

* Phospholipid Biosynthesis and Remodelling
- PLs are a source of bioactive lipids released from
  membranes by a large family of enzymes, called phospholipases
- inborn errors of PL metabolism often affect the central and
  peripheral nervous systems, but also muscle, eye, skin, bone,
  cartilage, liver, kidney and immune system

** Inborn Errors of Phospholipid Biosynthesis
- seven inherited disorders of /de novo/ PL synthesis have been described:
  - three involve proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum
    (Figure [[fig:pl]] steps 1,2 and 3)
  - four are proteins of the mitochondrial membrane (Figure
    [[fig:pl]] steps 4, 5 and 6)
- distinction between /de novo/ synthesis and re-modelling defects is
  unclear in some cases

** Inborn Errors related to Phospholipid Remodeling
- six inborn errors of metabolism linked to hydrolases and lipases
  involved in the remodelling of membrane phos pholipids have been
  described
- most present with neurodegenerative features including spastic
  paraplegia, peripheral neuropathy, neuroendocrine and ophthalmologic
  findings
