* Introduction
- Acylglycerols and phospholipids (PL) play a myriad of organ-specific
  roles in cell structure, biochemistry and signalling
- Inborn errors of glycerolipid metabolism cause a correspondingly
  vast array of clinical phenotypes
- Molecular analysis is currently the principal diagnostic
  technique

- Next generation sequencing has recently led to the discovery of
  several genetic defects of the biosynthesis and remodelling of
  triglycerides (TGs), other acyl-glycerols and of PLs

- Few disorders of glycerolipid metabolism have distinct metabolite
  patterns by conventional techniques
- Some of these conditions produce striking clinical syndromes
  identifiable in infancy
- others are mildly atypical forms of common adult conditions like:
  - metabolic syndrome
  - type II diabetes
- Inborn errors of intracellular TG metabolism often affect adipose
  tissue, but non-adipose signs can dominate their clinical
  presentation
- Inborn errors of PL metabolism often affect the central and
  peripheral nervous systems, but also muscle, eye, skin, bone,
  cartilage, liver, kidney and immune system

- Phospholipids (PLs) form the bilayer of cell membranes
- PLs all share a phosphate group that constitutes a hydrophilic head,
  located on the surface of the bilayer and a fatty acid chain that
  forms a hydrophobic tail, located inside
- Triglycerides (TGs) are extremely hydrophobic, and form droplets
  that are surrounded by a PL monolayer
- The first steps of TG and of PL synthesis are the same
- De novo synthesis begins from glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), which is formed from glycerol or from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)
  - an intermediate of both glycolysis and of gluconeogenesis
- G3P is esterified twice:
  1) glycerolphosphate acyltransferases (GPATs) to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
  2) acylglycerol acyltransferases (AGPATs) to form phosphatidic acid (PA)
- PA can either be converted into
  - an sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) by phosphatidic acid phosphatases or
  - CDP-diacylglycerol by phosphatidic acid cytidyltransferase (CDP-DAG synthase)
- DG is an essential intermediate for the synthesis of triglycerides (TG) and of three major PLs:
  1) phosphatidyl choline (P-Chol)
  2) phosphatidyl ethanolamine (P-Eth)
  3) phosphatidyl serine (P-Ser)

* TG biosynthesis and lipolysis
 - Phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAPs, LPIN1-3) catalyse phosphate
   removal, the first dedicated step of TG synthesis, creating a sn-1,2-diacylglycerol
 - Then one of two diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) can catalyze TG synthesis
 - TGs accumulate between the leaflets of the ER lipid bilayer
 - The  budding of lipid droplets (LDs) requires seipin
 - Perilipins arefound on the surface of all LDs; perilipin 1 is the most abundant LD surface protein of adipocytes
 - Adipocyte lipolysis is activated during fasting to export fatty
   acids (FAs) and glycerol for fuel
 - The main TG lipase in adipocytes, adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is on the LD surface
 - DGs are hydrolyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) , producing
   mainly sn-1-MGs.
 - Monoacylglyceride hydrolase (s) liberate glycerol and a FA
 - Perilipin 1 suppresses lipolysis in the fed state; beta adrenergic
   stimulation and low circulating insulin levels favor PLIN1 and HSL
   phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), activating lipolysis

** Inborn Errors of Phospholipid Biosynthesis
- Seven inherited disorders of de novo PL synthesis have been described.
- Three involve proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure [[fig:pl]] steps 1,2 and 3)
- The other four are proteins of the mitochondrial membrane (Figure [[fig:pl]] steps 4, 5 and 6)
- The distinction between de novo synthesis and re-modelling defects is unclear in some cases,

** Inborn Errors related to Phospholipid Remodeling
- PLs are a source of bioactive lipids released from
  membranes by a large family of enzymes, called phospholipases
- Diacylglycerol can be formed from membrane phospholipids by
  phospholipase C
  - converted by diacylglycerol lipase into 2-arachidonoylglycerol
  - hydrolyzed into arachidonic acid by alpha beta hydrolase 12 (ABHD12)
- PLs also hydrolyzed at the sn-2 position by phospholipases A2, such
  as PLA2G6
- at the sn-1 position by phospholipases A1, such as DDHD1 and DDHD2,
  releasing free fatty acid and lysophopholipid
  (LysoPC)
- Lysophospholipids are hydrolyzed by lysophos pholipases, such as
  PNPLA6 (NTE) into phosphoglycerol and fatty acid
- Archidonic acid released by phospholipases is a precursor of eicosanoids such as
  hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE and 20-HETE)
- Phosphatidylinositol (P-Ins) is a membrane phospholipid composed of
  diacylglycerol and a D-myo-inositol head group.
- In mammals, the inositol ring can be phosphorylated and
  dephosphorylated by a number of kinases and phosphatases to yield
  seven phosphoinositide derivatives (PI-3P, PI-4P, PI-5P etc...)
- Arachidonate-rich phosphoinositides are also believed to be another
  source of PLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release for the synthesis
  of prostaglandins and leukotrienes
