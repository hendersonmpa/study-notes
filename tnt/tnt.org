* Chapter 2: Human Genome
** Mitosis
- Prophase :: condensation of the chromosomes
  - formation of the mitotic spindle,
  - formation of a pair of centrosomes, from which microtubules
    radiate and eventually take up positions at the poles of the cell.
- Prometaphase :: nuclear membrane dissolves
  - chromosomes disperse within the cell
  - attach, by their kinetochores, to microtubules of the mitotic
   spindle.
- Metaphase :: the chromosomes condensed and line up at the equatorial
               plane.
- Anaphase ::  chromosomes separate at the centromere
  - sister chromatids of each chromosome now become independent
    daughter chromosomes, which move to opposite poles of the cell.
- Telophase :: chromosomes begin to decondense
  - nuclear membrane begins to re-form around each of the two daughter
    nuclei
  - cytoplasm cleaves = cytokinesis

** Meiosis

- Meiosis I is also known as the reduction division because it is the
  division in which the chromosome number is reduced by half through
  the pairing of homologues in prophase and by their segregation to
  different cells at anaphase of meiosis I.
- the stage at which genetic recombination (also called meiotic crossing over) occurs.
  - homologous segments of DNA are exchanged between non-sister
    chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes, thus ensuring
    that none of the gametes produced by meiosis will be identical to
    another.
- Theconceptual and practical consequences of recombination for many
aspects of human gen

** Homologous Recombination

- the genetic content of each gamete is unique, because of random
  assortment of the parental chromosomes to shuffle the combination of
  sequence variants between chromosomes and because of homologous
  recombination to shuffle the combination of sequence variants within
  each and every chromosome.
- This has significant consequences for patterns of genomic variation
  among and between different populations around the globe and for
  diagnosis and counseling of many common conditions with complex patterns of inheritance.
- The amounts and patterns of meiotic recombination are determined by
  sequence variants in specific genes and at specific “hot spots” and
  differ between individuals, between the sexes, between families, and
  between populations
- Because recombination involves the physical intertwining of the two
  homologues until the appropriate point during meiosis I, it is also
  critical for ensuring proper chromosome segregation during
  meiosis.
- Failure to recombine properly can lead to chromosome missegregation
  (nondisjunction) in meiosis I and is a frequent cause of pregnancy
  loss and of chromosome abnormalities like Down syndrome
- Although homologous recombination is normally precise, areas of
  repetitive DNA in the genome and genes of variable copy number in
  the population are prone to occasional unequal crossing over during
  meiosis, leading to variations in clinically relevant traits such as
  drug response, to common disorders such as the thalassemias or
  autism, or to abnormalities of sexual differentiation
- Although homologous recombination is a normal and essential part of
  meiosis, it also occurs, albeit more rarely, in somatic
  cells.
- Anomalies in somatic recombination are one of the causes of genome
  instability in cancer

* Chapter 3: Gene Structure and Function
** Allelic Imbalance in Gene Expression
- Monoallelic gene expression
  - Somatic rearrangement - T-cell receptors
  - random monoallelic expression
  - parent-of-origin imprinting
- X chromosome inactivation
  - random, X inactivation center
  - ncRNA called XIST

* Chapter 4: Human Genetic Diversity
** Inherited variation and polymorphism
- SNP
- Indels
- microsatelite
- mobile element insertion polymorphism
  - retrotranspostion: Alu, LINE
- CNVs
  - related to indels and microsatellites but variation in
    the number of copies of larger segments of the genome
  - 1000 bp to many hundreds of kilobase pairs.
- Inversion polymorphism
  - few base pairs up to several megabase pairs
  - can be present in either of two orientations in the genomes of different individuals

** Origins and Freq of Mutation types
- germline
- somatic
- Mutations:
  - Chromosome number
  - Regional: affecting the structure or regional organization of chromosomes
  - Gene: base pair substitutions, insertions, and deletions

** X linked 
*** Transmission
- Daughters always inherit Dad's X
- Moms transmit one X
- Sons have phenotype
- Daughters are carriers

*** Prior probability that female is a carrier of X linked lethal disorder 
- H is the population frequency of female carriers
- There are there ways a female can be a carrier:
  1) inherits from a carrier mother
     - 1/2  H
  2) receives a new mutant allele on X from mom
     - \mu
  3) receives a new mutant allele on X from dad
     - \mu
\[H = (1/2 \cdot H) + \mu + \mu \]
\[H = H/2 +2\mu \]
\[H = 4\mu \]

- The incidence of carrier females in next generation (C_{n+1}) will
  be 1/2 the previous generation (C_{n}) plus the mutation rate in
  females (\mu) plus the mutation rate in males (\nu)

\[C_{n+1} = 1/2 \cdot C_n + \mu + \nu \]

- same as above

| cond [fn:1] | 1/2  | \mu |
| joint       | 2\mu | \mu |
| post        | 2/3  | 1/3 |


- 2/3 inherited from mom
- 1/3 /de novo/
