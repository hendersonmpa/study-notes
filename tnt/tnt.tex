\section{Chapter 2: Human Genome}
\label{sec:org77cae0f}
\subsection{Mitosis}
\label{sec:orgedab219}
\begin{description}
\item[{Prophase}] condensation of the chromosomes
\begin{itemize}
\item formation of the mitotic spindle,
\item formation of a pair of centrosomes, from which microtubules
radiate and eventually take up positions at the poles of the cell.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Prometaphase}] nuclear membrane dissolves
\begin{itemize}
\item chromosomes disperse within the cell
\item attach, by their kinetochores, to microtubules of the mitotic
spindle.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Metaphase}] the chromosomes condensed and line up at the equatorial
plane.
\item[{Anaphase}] chromosomes separate at the centromere
\begin{itemize}
\item sister chromatids of each chromosome now become independent
daughter chromosomes, which move to opposite poles of the cell.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Telophase}] chromosomes begin to decondense
\begin{itemize}
\item nuclear membrane begins to re-form around each of the two daughter
nuclei
\item cytoplasm cleaves = cytokinesis
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection{Meiosis}
\label{sec:orgdaf4a55}

\begin{itemize}
\item Meiosis I is also known as the reduction division because it is the
division in which the chromosome number is reduced by half through
the pairing of homologues in prophase and by their segregation to
different cells at anaphase of meiosis I.
\item the stage at which genetic recombination (also called meiotic crossing over) occurs.
\begin{itemize}
\item homologous segments of DNA are exchanged between non-sister
chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes, thus ensuring
that none of the gametes produced by meiosis will be identical to
another.
\end{itemize}
\item Theconceptual and practical consequences of recombination for many
\end{itemize}
aspects of human gen

Meiosis}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Homologous Recombination}
\label{sec:org0dd0eb4}

\begin{itemize}
\item the genetic content of each gamete is unique, because of random
assortment of the parental chromosomes to shuffle the combination of
sequence variants between chromosomes and because of homologous
recombination to shuffle the combination of sequence variants within
each and every chromosome.
\item This has significant consequences for patterns of genomic variation
among and between different populations around the globe and for
diagnosis and counseling of many common conditions with complex patterns of inheritance.
\item The amounts and patterns of meiotic recombination are determined by
sequence variants in specific genes and at specific “hot spots” and
differ between individuals, between the sexes, between families, and
between populations
\item Because recombination involves the physical intertwining of the two
homologues until the appropriate point during meiosis I, it is also
critical for ensuring proper chromosome segregation during
meiosis.
\item Failure to recombine properly can lead to chromosome missegregation
(nondisjunction) in meiosis I and is a frequent cause of pregnancy
loss and of chromosome abnormalities like Down syndrome
\item Although homologous recombination is normally precise, areas of
repetitive DNA in the genome and genes of variable copy number in
the population are prone to occasional unequal crossing over during
meiosis, leading to variations in clinically relevant traits such as
drug response, to common disorders such as the thalassemias or
autism, or to abnormalities of sexual differentiation
\item Although homologous recombination is a normal and essential part of
meiosis, it also occurs, albeit more rarely, in somatic
cells.
\item Anomalies in somatic recombination are one of the causes of genome
instability in cancer
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Problems of early growth and development
\label{sec:org7985ddf}
\begin{itemize}
\item failure to thrive, developmental delay,dysmorphic facies, multiple
malformations, short stature, ambiguous genitalia, and
intellectual disability are frequent findings in children with
chromosome abnormalities
\end{itemize}
\item Stillbirth and neonatal death
\label{sec:org608cdf9}
\begin{itemize}
\item incidence of chromosome abnormalities is much higher among
stillbirths (\(\sim\)10\%) than among live births (\(\sim\)0.7\%)
\item also elevated among infants who die in the neonatal period (\textasciitilde{}10\%)
\item karyotyping (or other comprehensive ways of scanning the genome) is
essential for accurate genetic counseling
\end{itemize}
\item Fertility problems

amenorrhea and for couples with a history of infertility or recurrent miscarriage
\item chromosome abnormality is seen in one or the other parent in 3\% to
6\% of cases in which there is infertility or two or more
miscarriages
\end{itemize}
\item Family history
\label{sec:org8a39e01}
\begin{itemize}
\item known or suspected chromosome or genome abnormality in a first
degree relative is an indication for chromosome and genome analysis
\end{itemize}
\item Neoplasia
\label{sec:org431b996}
\begin{itemize}
\item virtually all cancers are associated with one or more chromosome
abnormalities
\item chromosome and genome evaluation in the tumor itself, or in bone
marrow in the case of hematological malignant neoplasms, can offer
diagnostic or prognostic information
\end{itemize}
\item Pregnancy
\label{sec:orgb06edf2}
\begin{itemize}
\item a higher risk for chromosome abnormality in fetuses conceived by
women of increased age, typically defined as \textgreater{} 35 years
\item fetal chromosome and genome analysis should be offered as a routine
part of prenatal care in such pregnancies
\item NIPT is a screening approach for the most common chromosome
disorders and is now available to pregnant women of all ages
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Chromosome Identification}
\label{sec:org12029b6}
\begin{itemize}
\item G-banding (Giemsa) is the gold standard for detection and
characterization of structural and numerical genomic abnormalities
\begin{itemize}
\item both constitutional (postnatal or prenatal) and acquired (cancer)
\item detection of deletions and duplications \textgreater{} 5 to 10 Mb
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
than approximately 5 to 10 Mb anywhere in the genome
\begin{itemize}
\item three types of chromosomes:
\begin{description}
\item[{metacentric}] central centromere
\item[{submetacentric}] off center centromere
\item[{acrocentric}] centromere at one end
\begin{itemize}
\item 13,14,15,21,22
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization}
\label{sec:orge0df1cf}
\begin{itemize}
\item detecting the presence or absence of a particular DNA sequence or
for evaluating the number or organization of a chromosome or
chromosomal region \emph{in situ}
\item uses ordered collections of recombinant DNA clones containing DNA
from around the entire genome
\item limited by the need to target a specific genomic region based
\end{itemize}
on a clinical diagnosis or suspicion

\subsection{Microarrays}
\label{sec:org88a3189}
\begin{itemize}
\item comparative genome hybridization (CGH)
\begin{itemize}
\item detects relative copy number gains and losses genome-wide by
hybridizing two samples:
\begin{itemize}
\item control genome
\item patient
\end{itemize}
\item excess of sequences from one or the other genome indicates an
overrepresentation or underrepresentation of those sequences in the
patient genome relative to the control
\end{itemize}
\item SNP arrays
\begin{itemize}
\item relative representation and intensity of alleles in different
regions of the genome indicate if a chromosome or chromosomal
region is present at the appropriate dosage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gene Dosage, Balance and Imbalance}
\label{sec:orgc4cd2bf}
\begin{itemize}
\item for chromosome and genomic disorders, it is the quantitative aspects
of gene expression that underlie disease, in contrast to single-gene
disorders, in which pathogenesis often reflects qualitative aspects
of a gene's function
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item monosomies are more deleterious than trisomies
\label{sec:orgbcb8219}
\begin{itemize}
\item complete monosomies are generally not viable, except for monosomy
for the X chromosome
\item complete trisomies are viable for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y
\end{itemize}

\item phenotype in partial aneuploidy depends on a number of factors
\label{sec:orge83cf10}
\begin{itemize}
\item size of the unbalanced segment
\item which regions of the genome are affected
\item which genes are involved
\item whether the imbalance is monosomic or trisomic
\end{itemize}
\item risk in cases of inversions depends on the location of the inversion with respect to the centromere and on the size of the inverted segment
\label{sec:org888606c}
\begin{itemize}
\item paracentric inversions do not involve the centromere
\begin{itemize}
\item very low risk for an abnormal phenotype in the next generation
\end{itemize}
\item pericentric inversions do involve the centromere
\begin{itemize}
\item risk for birth defects in offspring may be significant and
increases with the size of the inverted segment
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item mosaic karyotype involving any chromosome abnormality, all bets are off!
\label{sec:org2e50752}
\begin{itemize}
\item the degree of mosaicism in relevant tissues or relevant stages of
development is generally unknown
\item there is uncertainty about the severity of the phenotype
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Abnormalities of Chromosome Number}
\label{sec:org70a4928}
\begin{description}
\item[{heteroploid}] chromosome complement other than 46 is
\item[{euploid}] exact multiple of n
\item[{aneuploid}] non-multiple of n
\end{description}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Triploidy and tetraploidy
\label{sec:org1d2d0df}
\begin{itemize}
\item most result from fertilization of an egg by two sperm (dispermy)
\item also failure of one of the meiotic divisions in either sex,
resulting in a diploid egg or sperm
\item maternal source are aborted
\item paternal source \(\to\) degenerative placenta (parital hydatidiform
mole) w small fetus
\end{itemize}

\item Aneuploidy
\label{sec:orgdb8acb6}

\begin{description}
\item[{trisomy}] 21,18,13
\item[{monosomy}] X (Turner syndrome)

\item Delections and Duplications
\item Marker and Ring Chromosomes
\begin{itemize}
\item very small, unidentified chromosomes
\end{itemize}
\item Isochromosomes
\begin{itemize}
\item one arm is missing and the other duplicated in a mirror-image
\end{itemize}
\item Dicentric
\begin{itemize}
\item two chromosome segments, each with a centromere, fuse end to end
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Balanced rearrangements
\label{sec:orga475a3f}
\begin{itemize}
\item "balanced" depends on resolution
\item Translocations
\begin{itemize}
\item Reciprocal translocations
\item Robertsonian translocations
\item Insertions
\end{itemize}
\item Inversions
\begin{itemize}
\item paracentric - outside the centromere
\item pericentric - includes the centromere

\section{{\bfseries\sffamily STARTED} Chapter 6: Chromosomal and Genomic basis of Disease}
\label{sec:org6f20612}

\begin{itemize}
\item Disorders due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item abnormal chromosome segregation (nondisjunction)
\item recurrent chromosomal syndromes, involving
deletions or duplications at genomic hot spots
\item idiopathic chromosomal abnormalities, typically de novo
\item unbalanced familial chromosomal abnormalities
\item chromosomal and genomic events that reveal regions
of genomic imprinting
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./figures/ch6_mech.png}
\caption{\label{fig:orgc1b6573}
Mechanisms of chromosome abnormalities and genomic imbalance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Lessons From Genomic Disorders}
\label{sec:org98d40ea}
\begin{itemize}
\item altered gene dosage for any extensive chromosomal or genomic region
is likely to result in a clinical abnormality, the phenotype of
which will, in principle, reflect haploinsufficiency for or
overexpression of one or more genes encoded within the region.
\begin{itemize}
\item in some cases, the clinical presentation appears to be accounted
for by dosage imbalance for just a single gene; in other
syndromes, however, the phenotype appears to reflect imbalance for
multiple genes across the region
\end{itemize}
\item the distribution of these duplication/deletion disorders is not random,
\begin{itemize}
\item segmental duplications in pericentromeric and subtelomeric
regions, predisposes particular regions to the unequal
recombination events that underlie these syndromes
\end{itemize}
\item patients carrying what appears to be the same chromosomal deletion
or duplication can present with a range of variable phenotypes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aneuploidy}
\label{sec:org519b00e}
\begin{itemize}
\item common mutation in our species involves errors in chromosome segregation
\item only three well-defined nonmosaic chromosome disorders compatible
with postnatal survival in which there is an abnormal dose of an
entire autosome:
\begin{enumerate}
\item trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)
\item trisomy 18
\item trisomy 13
\end{enumerate}
\item also have the \(\downarrow\) genes among autosomes
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Down Syndrome
\label{sec:orgb8af71c}
\begin{itemize}
\item see conditions
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Robertsonian Translocation
\label{sec:org515d155}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\sim\)4\% of Down syndrome patients have 46 chromosomes
\item one of which is a Robertsonian translocation between chromosome
21q and the long arm of one of the other acrocentric chromosomes
(usually chromosome 14 or 22)
\item 46,XX or XY,rob(14;21)(q10;q10),+21
\end{itemize}

\caption{\label{fig:org3476443}
Chromosomes of gametes that theoretically can be produced by a carrier of a Robertsonian translocation, rob(14;21)}
\end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

\item Uniparental Disomy
\label{sec:orgae9ecff}
\begin{itemize}
\item nondisjunction \(\to\) both copies of a chromosome derive from the same
parent
\begin{itemize}
\item called uniparental disomy
\item defined as the presence of a disomic cell line containing two
chromosomes, or portions thereof, that are inherited from only one
parent
\end{itemize}
\item isodisomy if  two chromosomes are derived from identical sister chromatids
\item heterodisomy if if both homologues from one parent are present
\item common explanation for uniparental disomy is trisomy “rescue” due to
chromosome nondisjunction in cells of a trisomic conceptus to
restore a disomic state
\end{itemize}

\item Contiguous Gene Syndrome
\label{sec:org8853b12}
\begin{itemize}
\item segmental aneusomy is a form of genetic imbalance due to recurrent
subchromosomal or regional abnormalities
\begin{itemize}
\item typically detected by microarray
\item called contiguous gene syndrome
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Idiopathic Chromosome Abnormalities}
\label{sec:orgc16324d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Autosomal deletion syndromes
\begin{itemize}
\item cri du chat syndrome, there is either a terminal or interstitial
deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5
\end{itemize}
\item Balanced translocations with developmental phenotypes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disorders Associated with Genomic Imprinting}
\label{sec:org910bf2f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prader-Willi
\item Angelman syndrome
\item Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

\section{{\bfseries\sffamily STARTED} Chapter 9: Genetic Variation in Populations}
\label{sec:orgee14c5b}
\subsection{Hardy-Weinberg}
\label{sec:orgfcb6a75}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Hardy-Weinberg law states that the frequency of the three
genotypes AA, Aa, and aa is given by the terms of the binomial
expansion of (p + q)\(^{\text{2}}\) = p\(^{\text{2}}\) + 2pq + q\(^{\text{2}}\)
\item p = the frequency of the dominant allele (represented here by A)
\item q = the frequency of the recessive allele (represented here by a)

\item For a population in genetic equilibrium:
\begin{itemize}
\item p + q = 1.0 (The sum of the frequencies of both alleles is 100\%)
\item (p + q)\(^{\text{2}}\) = 1
\item p\(^{\text{2}}\) + 2pq + q\(^{\text{2}}\) = 1
\end{itemize}
\item The three terms of this binomial expansion indicate the frequencies
of the three genotypes:
\begin{itemize}
\item p2 = frequency of AA (homozygous dominant)
\item 2pq = frequency of Aa (heterozygous)
\item q2 = frequency of aa (homozygous recessive)
\end{itemize}

\item The Hardy-Weinberg law rests on these assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The population under study is large, and matings are random with
respect to the locus in question
\item Allele frequencies remain constant over time because of the
following:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no appreciable rate of new mutation.• Individuals with
all genotypes are equally capable of mating and passing on their
genes; that is, there is no selection against any particular
genotype
\item There has been no significant immigration of individuals from a
population with allele frequencies very different from the
endogenous population
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item A population that reasonably appears to meet these assumptions is
considered to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
\item Then population genotype frequencies from generation to generation
will remain constant, at equilibrium, if the allele frequencies p
and q remain constant.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Inheritance & Population Freq & \\
\hline
AR & q\(^{\text{2}}\) & homozygote\\
AD & 2pq & heterozygotes\\
XL & 1/2 \(\cdot\) q\(^{\text{2}}\) & hemizygote males\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Factors That Disturb Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium}
\label{sec:orge453294}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exceptions to Large Populations with Random Mating
\label{sec:orga6cf10f}
\begin{itemize}
\item stratification
\item assortative mating
\item consaguinity
\end{itemize}
\item Exceptions to Constant Allele Frequencies
\label{sec:org70a8981}
\begin{itemize}
\item mutation
\item selection and fitness
\begin{itemize}
\item selection in dominant disease
\item selection in recessive disease - less effect
\end{itemize}
\item Mutation and Selection Balance in Dominant Disease
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\mu\) = sq
\begin{itemize}
\item q = mutant allele freq
\item s = coefficient of selection
\item \(\mu\) = mutation rate per generation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Mutation and Selection Balance in X-Linked Recessive Mutations.
\label{sec:org4792f7a}
\begin{itemize}
\item males have one X chromosome and females two, the pool of X-linked
alleles in the entire population’s gene pool is partitioned at any
given time, with one third of mutant alleles present in males and
two thirds in females
\item if the incidence of a serious X-linked disease is not changing and
selection is operating against (and only against) hemizygous males,
the mutation rate then µ, must equal the coefficient of selection, s
times q, the allele frequency, adjusted by a factor of 3 because
selection is operating only on the third of the mutant alleles in
the population that are present in males at any time. Thus,
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\mu\) = sq/3
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\label{sec:org6682a2c}
\subsection{Birth Defects}
\label{sec:org6efcf61}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Malformations
\label{sec:orgfbbfc55}
\begin{itemize}
\item result from intrinsic abnormalities in one or more genetic programs
operating in development. An example of a malformation is the extra
fingers in the disorder known as Greig cephalopolysyndactyly
\item arise from intrinsic defects in genes that specify a series of
developmental steps or programs, and because such programs are often
used more than once in different parts of the embryo or fetus at
different stages of development, a malformation in one part of the
body is often but not always associated with malformations elsewhere
as well
\end{itemize}
\item Deformations
\label{sec:orgc87580a}
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by extrinsic factors impinging physically on the fetus during
development
\item common during the second trimester of development when the fetus is
constrained within the amniotic sac and uterus
\begin{itemize}
\item for example contractions of the joints of the extremities, known
as arthrogryposes, in combination with deformation of the
developing skull, occasionally accompany constraint of the fetus
due to twin or triplet gestations or prolonged leakage of amniotic
fluid
\end{itemize}
\item most deformations apparent at birth either resolve spontaneously or
can be treated by external fixation devices to reverse the effects
of the instigating cause
\end{itemize}
\item Disruptions
\label{sec:org5db352d}
\begin{itemize}
\item result from destruction of irreplaceable normal fetal
tissue
\item more difficult to treat than deformations because they involve
actual loss of normal tissue
\item may be the result of vascular insufficiency, trauma, or
teratogens
\item one example is amnion disruption, the partial amputation of a fetal
limb associated with strands of amniotic tissue
\item amnion disruption is often recognized clinically by the presence of
partial and irregular digit amputations in conjunction with
constriction rings
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Chapter 15: Cancer}
\label{sec:org6904273}
\begin{itemize}
\item cancer is not a single disease but rather comes in many forms and
degrees of malignancy
\item there are three main classes of cancer:
\begin{description}
\item[{sarcomas}] tumor has arisen in mesenchymal tissue, such as bone,
muscle, or connective tissue, or in nervous system
tissue
\item[{carcinomas}] originate in epithelial tissue, such as the cells
lining the intestine, bronchi, or mammary ducts
\item[{hematopoietic and lymphoid}] leukemia and lymphoma which spread
throughout the bone marrow, lymphatic system, and peripheral
blood
\end{description}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genetic Basis of Cancer}
\label{sec:org79a2597}
\begin{itemize}
\item driver and passenger mutations
\item particular translocations are sometimes highly specific for certain
types of cancer and involve specific genes
\begin{itemize}
\item BCR-ABL translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia
\end{itemize}
\item cancers can also show complex rearrangements in which chromosomes
break into numerous pieces and rejoin, forming novel and complex
combinations (a process known as “chromosome shattering”)
\item large genomic alterations involving many kilobases of DNA can form
the basis for loss of function or increased function of one or more
driver genes

\item genes in which mutations cause cancer are referred to as \textbf{driver}
\textbf{genes}, and the cancer causing mutations in these genes are \textbf{driver}
\textbf{mutations}
\item driver genes fall into two distinct categories
\begin{enumerate}
\item activated oncogenes
\item tumor suppressor genes (TSGs)
\end{enumerate}

\item an activated oncogene is a mutant allele of a proto-oncogene, a
class of normal cellular protein-coding genes that promotes growth
and survival of cells
\item oncogenes facilitate malignant transformation by stimulating
proliferation or inhibiting apoptosis
\item oncogenes encode proteins such as the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item proteins in signaling pathways for cell proliferation
\item transcription factors that control the expression of growth-promoting genes
\item inhibitors of programmed cell death machinery
\end{itemize}
\item A TSG is a gene in which loss of function through mutation or
epigenomic silencing directly removes normal regulatory controls on
cell growth or leads indirectly to such losses through an increased
mutation rate or aberrant gene expression
\item TSGs encode proteins involved in many aspects of cellular function including:
\begin{itemize}
\item maintenance of correct chromosome number and structure
\item DNA repair proteins
\item proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle, cellular
proliferation or contact inhibition
\end{itemize}

\item tumor initiation can be caused by different types of genetic
alterations:
\begin{itemize}
\item activating or gain-of-function mutations
\item ectopic and heterochronic mutations of protooncogenes
\item chromosome translocations that cause misexpression of genes or chimeric genes
\item LOF of both alleles, or a dominant negative mutation of one allele, of TSGs
\end{itemize}

\item tumor progression occurs as a result of accumulating additional
genetic damage,through mutations or epigenetic silencing, of driver
genes that encode the machinery that repairs damaged DNA and
maintains cytogenetic normality
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cancer in Families}
\label{sec:orgd0495bc}

\begin{itemize}
\item germline mutation - inherited
\item second-hit
\begin{itemize}
\item somatic mutation
\item loss of heterozygozity around locus
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sporadic Cancer}
\label{sec:org94b8762}
\begin{itemize}
\item activation of oncogenes by point mutation
\item activation of oncogenes by chromosome translocation
\begin{itemize}
\item best-known example is the translocation between chromosomes 9 and
22 (Philadelphia chromosome) that is seen in CML
\item moves the protooncogene ABL1, a tyrosine kinase, from its normal
position on chromosome 9q to a gene of unknown function, BCR, on
chromosome 22q
\item results in the synthesis of a novel, chimeric protein, BCR-ABL1 w
enhanced tyrosine kinase activity
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cytogenetic Changes in Cancer}
\label{sec:org9464c80}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Aneuploidy and Aneusomy
\label{sec:org6701afc}
\begin{itemize}
\item when CML, with the 9;22 Philadelphia chromosome, evolves from the
typically indolent chronic phase to a severe, life-threatening blast
crisis, there may be several additional cytogenetic abnormalities,
including numerical or structural changes, such as a second copy of
the 9;22 translocation chromosome or an isochromosome for 17q

\item another cytogenetic aberration seen in many cancers is gene
amplification, a phenomenon in which many additional copies of a
segment of the genome are present in the cell
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{double minutes} (very small accessory chromosomes)
\item \textbf{homogeneously staining regions} that do not band normally and
contain multiple, amplified copies of a particular DNA segment
\end{itemize}
\item known to include extra copies of proto-oncogenes such as the genes
encoding Myc, Ras, and epithelial growth factor receptor, which
stimulate cell growth, block apoptosis, or both
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Targeted Cancer Therapy}
\label{sec:org29b74bd}
\begin{itemize}
\item The proof of principle for this approach was established with the
development of imatinib, a highly effective inhibitor of a number of
tyrosine kinases, including the ABL1 kinase in CML
\item Prolonged remissions of this disease have been seen, in some cases
with apparently indefinite postponement of the transformation into a
virulent acute leukemia (blast crisis) that so often meant the end
of a CML patient’s life
\item Additional kinase inhibitors have been developed to target other
activated oncogene driver genes in a variety of tumor types
\item initial results with targeted therapies, although very promising in
some cases, have not led to permanent cures in most patients because
tumors develop resistance to the targeted therapy
\item The outgrowth of resistant tumors because cancer cells are highly
mutable, and their genomes undergo recurrent mutation
\end{itemize}

\section{1/3 Rule}
\label{sec:org024dfbb}
If the reproductive fitness of a male affected with an X-linked
recessive disorder is low or nil, then in a population \textbf{one-third of}
\textbf{all affected X chromosomes will be removed from the gene pool every
generation}. If the incidence of the disease is constant, then
one-third of cases must be due to mutations arising \emph{de novo} in a
family.
