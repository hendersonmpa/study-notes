* Introduction

** Niemann-Pick Disease
- There are two distinct diseases called Niemann-Pick
  - Types A and B (acid sphingomyelinase deficiency)
  - Type C (cholesterol recycling)

** Niemann-Pick A & B
- Incidence of Niemann-Pick A among Ashkenazi Jews ~ 1:40,000.
- Incidence of both Niemann–Pick A and B in all other populations ~ 1:250,000.
- Niemann-Pick Type A and B are caused by deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM).
  - sphingomyelinase is required to metabolize sphingomyelin.
  - results in progressive accumulation of sphingomyelin in systemic organs
    - brain accumulation in neuronal forms
  - There is growing evidence that NPA & NPB represent opposite ends of a continuum.
    - NPA generally have little or no ASM production (less than 1% of normal).
    - NPB have approximately 10% of normal level of ASM.

** Niemann-Pick C
- a fatal, neuro-degenerative disease that affects ~ 1:150,000
  - sometimes referred to as Childhood Alzheimer’s
  - extremely heterogeneous
  - biochemically, genetically and clinically distinct from Niemann-Pick A and B. 
- Accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycolipids in systemic organs
- GM2 and GM3 accumulate in brain
  - no increase in cholesterol
- NPC has two sub types NP-C1 (95%) and NP-C2 (5%)

** Niemann-Pick C

- LDL cholesterol enters cells via endocytosis at the LDL receptor.
- delivered to the late-stage endosomes and lysosomes
- hydrolyzed and released as free cholesterol.
- Unesterified cholesterol is transported to the plasma membrane and the ER for recycling.

- In NP-C, the LDL-cholesterol is trapped in lysosomes

** NPC1 & NPC2

#+NAME: fig:npc

- NPC1 is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in transport in the endosomal-lysosomal system
- NPC2 acts in cooperation with the NPC1
- The disruption of transport results in accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes.

** Lysosomal Protein Trafficking

#+CAPTION[]:Lysosomal protein trafficking receptors
#+NAME: fig:traf
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.65\textwidth
[[file:./niemann_pick/figures/lysosome_trafficking.jpeg]]

- lysosomal trafficking of acid sphingomyelinase is mediated by sortilin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor.
- MPR alone is sufficient to transport NPC2 to the endo/lysosomal compartment
- Sorting of LMPs from Golgi/PM to endosomal system is mediated by
  signals in the cytosolic domain

** Genetics

*** Niemann-Pick A & B
- Mutations in SMPD1
- Good phenotype-genotype correlation
*** Niemann-Pick C
- Autosomal recessive inheritance,
- Mutations in NPC1 (95%) and NPC2 (5%)

* Clinical Findings

** Niemann-Pick A & B symptoms

*** Niemann-Pick A symptoms
- hepatosplenomegaly by age 3 months
- Failure to thrive
- Psychomotor regression at age 1
  - progressive loss of abilities – mental and physical
- Interstitial lung disease resulting in lung infections and lung failure
- Cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (100%)

*** Niemann-Pick B symptoms
- Symptoms outlined under NPA (but less severe)
- Thrombocytopenia 
- Short stature
- Cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (50%)

** Niemann-Pick C symptoms

- onset of the disease can happen at any age.
  - often school age children.
  - also adults

- Symptoms may include:
  - Jaundice at birth or shortly afterwards
  - Hepatosplenomegaly
  - Vertical supranuclear gaze palzy
  - Ataxia
  - Dystonia
  - Dysarthria
  - Cognitive dysfunction/dementia
  - Cataplexy
  - Tremors accompanying movement
  - Seizures
  - Dysphagia

*** Definitions:
- Vertical Supranuclear Gaze Palzy: Difficulty with Upward & Downward Eye Movement 
- Ataxia: Unsteadiness with Gait, Clumsiness or Walking 
- Dystonia:  neurological movement disorder syndrome in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures
- Dysarthria: Slurred Irregular Speech 
- Cognitive Dysfunction/Dementia: Learning Difficulties & Progressive Intellectual Decline 
- Cataplexy: Sudden Loss of Muscle Tone Which May Lead to Unexpected Falls 
- Dysphagia:Swallowing Problems 
- Thrombocytopenia: low number of platelets

** Niemann-Pick C neurological forms

\small
- Classification by neurological form is widely used
- correlation between age at neurological onset and course of disease
  and lifespan has been established

**** Early infantile          
- pre-existing hepatosplenomegaly
- delay in motor milestones 9m-2yrs
- survival <6 years

**** Late-infantile
- classic NPC, 60-70% of cases
- language delay
- Ataxia, 3-5 yrs
- Cognitive dysfunction, 6-12 yrs 

**** Adult 
- diagnosis 15->60yrs.
- insidious presentation
- ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria, movement disorders
- variable cognitive dysfunction
- Vertical gaze palzy common

* Laboratory Investigations
** Newborn Screening
- New York state is conducting a pilot newborn screening program for four lysosomal storage disorders.
- Pompe, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick A/B, Fabry, and MPS 1

- 4 years, 65,605 infants participated, representing an overall consent rate of 73%.
  - Sixty-nine infants were screen-positive.
  - Twenty-three were confirmed true positives, all of whom were predicted to have late-onset phenotypes.
  - Six of the 69 currently have undetermined disease status.

** Biomarkers: oxysterols

- Plasma oxysterols
  - oxysterols cholestane-3\beta, 5\alpha, 6\beta-triol
  - 7-ketocholesterol

* Treatment
** Treatment: Niemann-Pick A&B 
- No approved treatments
- Olipudase alfa, a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), is
  an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of nonneurologic
  manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD).
- ongoing, open-label, long-term study (NCT02004704) assessed safety
  and efficacy of olipudase alfa following 30 months of treatment in
  five adult patients with ASMD.
- There were no deaths, serious or severe events, or discontinuations
  during 30 months of treatment.
- Chitotriosidase in serum and lyso-sphingomyelin in dried blood spots
  decreased with olipudase alfa treatment

** Treatment: Niemann-Pick C
- substrate reduction therapy
  - miglustat approved for treatment of neurological manifestations
  - miglustat is an iminosugar, a synthetic analogue of D-glucose
