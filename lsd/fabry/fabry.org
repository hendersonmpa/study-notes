* Introduction

** Fabry

- AKA: angiokeratoma corporis diffusum universale
- Second most common LSD
- 1:339,000 heterozygote females in the UK
- First described in 1898 independently by Anderson and Fabry
  - Dermatologists
- Defect in \alpha-galactosidase A (ceramide trihexosidase)
  - Inability to cleave terminal galactose from the sphingolipid globotriaosylceramide Gb3 (galactosylgalactosylglucoceramide)
  - 3 to 20% activity in hemizygote males
- Lack of \alpha-GalA leads to accumulation of Gb3 in blood vessels and other tissues
  - wide range of symptoms including kidney, heart, and skin symptoms
  - \uparrow [Gb3] in kidney and blood group B antigenic glycosphingolipid

- Located in the lumen of lysosomes

- \alpha-galactosidase A uses both sortilin and mannose receptor
  - Not affected in ML II & III

** Sortilin

- Sortilin is a type I transmembrane protein found in lysosomes
  - can transport several lysosomal proteins from the TGN or PM to the endosomes
- Tissues from sortilin knock-out mice exhibit normal morphology
- Sortilin may transport selected acid hydrolases in:
  - a subset of cell types
  - under stress conditions (e.g. Man-6-P pathway is deficient) 

** Megalin 
- a cell surface receptor involved in reabsorption of proteins at the kidney proximal tubule
- megalin mediated endocytosis of \alpha-galactosidase kidney proximal tubule 
- megalin also mediates the endocytosis of \alpha-galactosidase in renal podocytes

** Genetics
- The \alpha-galactosidase A gene is on the X chromosome
  - Xq22.1
- X-linked with penetrance in female heterozygotes
  - may be considered X-linked dominant
- More that 300 of mutations have been found
- Single nucleotide missense mutations identified in the majority of families
  - Mostly private mutations

* Clinical Findings

** Signs and Symptoms

- postprandial pain or diarrhea
  - may be sole complaint
- degradation of interphalangeal joints
- cerebrovascular - stroke, seizures
- ocular lesions


| Age         | Signs                                           |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Childhood   | Pain in extremities, fever, Fabry crisis [fn:1] |
| Adolescence | Angiokeratomas                                  |
| Adulthood   | Central nervous system symptoms                 |
|             | Myocardial and pulmonary disease                |
| Middle age  | Renal failure, lymphedema                       |


[fn:1] May be induced by heat, cold, fatigue or emotional stress


** Angiokeratomas

- prominent on hip, buttocks and scrotum

* Laboratory Investigations

** Biochemistry
- Deficient \alpha-galactosidase A activity in leukocytes
  - fluorometric 4MU-\alpha-D-galactopyranoside substrate
  - LC-MS/MS 
- NBS via \alpha-galactosidase A activity in DBS
  - Taiwan, MO, IL
- Elevated urine Gb3 and Gb2 in hemizygote males and heterozygote females
  - urine and DUS LC-MSMS assay
- Plasma lyso-Gb3 (globotriaosylsphingosine) is a sensitive biomarker
  - LC-MSMS
  - Useful in diagnosis and monitoring

** Pathology

- Widespread deposition of Gb3
- Vacuoles seen in variety of cells, \uparrow endothelium of blood vessels

* Treatment

** Treatment
- Alleviate pain
  - chronic low dose of diphenylhydantoin
  - carbamazapine, gabapentin
- Dialysis or renal transplantation
- There is long term experience with ERT
  - Agalsidase (alpha or beta)
  - Reduces left ventricular hypertrophy
  - Less effect on renal function
  - Does not prevent progression
- Oral chaperone therapy - migalastat
  - Only for amenable mutations
