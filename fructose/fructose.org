* Introduction
** Fructose Metabolism
- Fructose is mainly metabolised in the liver, renal cortex and small intestinal mucosa
- Pathway composed of fructokinase, aldolase B and triokinase.
- Aldolase B is also involved in the glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway

** Disorders of Fructose Metabolism
- Three inborn errors are known in the pathway of fructose metabolism.
- Essential fructosuria is a harmless anomaly
  - characterised by the appearance of fructose in the urine after the intake of fructose-containing food.
- Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI)
  - fructose may provoke prompt gastrointestinal discomfort and hypoglycaemia upon ingestion
  - fructose may cause liver and kidney failure when taken persistently,
  - IV fructose can be lethal
- Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency
  - considered an inborn error of fructose metabolism although, it is a defect of gluconeogenesis.
  - hypoglycaemia and lactic acidosis (neonatally, or later during fasting or induced by fructose)
  - may be life-threatening

** Fructose Metabolism
pathway

* Essential Fructosuria
** Clinical Presentation
- Rare non-disease
- Detected a when test urine for reducing substances
- Deficiency in Fructokinase
** Metabolic Derangement
- 10-20% of ingested fructose is excreted in urine
- remainder is slowly metabolised in adipose tissue and muscle
** Genetics
- AR, 1:130,000 (underestimate?)
- KHK undergoes tissue specific alternative splicing
  - Two isoforms
  - ketohexokinase A, widely expressed, no clear role
  - ketohexokinase C, adult liver, kidney and small intestine
    - affected in essential fructosuria
  - Only 2 mutations found
** Diagnosis and Treatment
- \uparrow reducing substances in urine
- glucose oxidase negative
- fructosuria is dependant on fructose intake
- no treatent required
- prognosis is excellent

* Hereditary Fructose Intolerance
** Clinical Presentation
- perfectly healthy as long as they do not ingest food containing fructose, sucrose and/or sorbitol
- no metabolic derangement occurs during breast-feeding
- younger the child and the higher the dietary fructose load, the more severe the reaction
- first symptoms appear with the intake of fruits and vegetables or fructose containing formula
  - gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, restlessness,
    pallor, sweating, trembling, lethargy and, eventually, apathy,
    coma, jerks and convulsion
- laboratory tests indicate acute liver failure and generalised dysfunction of the renal proximal tubules.
- hypoglycaemia after fructose ingestion is short-lived and can be easily missed or masked by concomitant glucose intake
- food aversions form
- approximately half of all adults with HFI are free of caries
- affected subjects may remain undiagnosed and still have a normal life span.

** Metabolic Derangement
- FI is caused by deficiency of the second enzyme of the fructose pathway, aldolase B
  - splits fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P) into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde
- The high activity of fructokinase after intake of fructose results in accumulation of F-1-P and trapping of phosphate.
- This has two major effects:
  1. inhibition of glucose production by blockage of gluconeogenesis
     (inhibition of aldolase A) and glycogenolysis (inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase A)
     - induces a rapid drop in blood glucose
  2. overutilization and diminished regeneration of ATP.
     - depletion of ATP results in an increased production of uric acid
     - a release of magnesium,
     - and a series of other disturbances,including impaired protein
       synthesis and ultrastructural lesions which are responsible for
       hepatic and renal dysfunction
- glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are not impaired in the fasted state in HFI patients due to activity of aldolase A

- same process happens in IV fructose to normal patients
- the use of fructose, sorbitol and invert sugar has been strongly discouraged for parenteral nutrition in general

** Genetics
- AR
- Three aldolase genes
- B is the major fructaldolase of liver, renal cortex, and small intestine
- A muscle
- C brain

** Diagnosis and Treatment
- nutritional history
- response to fructose withdrawl
- First tier molecular diagnosis
- Second tier (no mutations) Enzymatic
- Liver biopsy Aldo B activity
  - False low Aldo B secondary to liver damage

- acute intoxication:
  - fresh frozen plasma
- Remove fructose (sucrose and sorbitol) from diet
- Prognosis on diet is excellent with normal growth,
  intelligence and life span

* Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- 1/2 present in the first 1-4 days of life
  - severe hyperventilation
    - lactic acidosis
    - hypoglycaemia
- later irritability, apnoeic spells, tachycardia, muscle hypotonia
- chronic ingestion of fructose does not lead to gastrointestinal symptoms
  - no aversion to sweet foods or failure to thrive, and only rarely \downarrow liver function.

** Metabolic Derangement
- Deficiency of hepatic FBPase, key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, impairs
  the formation of glucose from all gluconeogenic precursors, including dietary fructose
- normoglycaemia in patients is dependent on glucose (and galactose)
  intake and degradation of hepatic glycogen
- hypoglycaemia occurs when glycogen reserves are limited (newborns, fasting)
- accumulation of the gluconeogenic substrates lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and glycerol.
** Genetics
- AR
- Liver isoform, FBP1 gene
- 35 mutations in all regions of the gene have been published

** Diagnosis
- plasma during acute episodes
  - \uparrow lactate (up to 15â€“25 mM)
  - \downarrow pH
  - \uparrow lactate/pyruvate ratio (up to 40)
  - hyperalaninaemia,
  - \uparrow glycerol which may mimic hypertriglyceridaemia
  - glucagon-resistant hypoglycaemia
  - \uparrow free fatty acids and uric acid.
- Urinary analysis reveals
  - \uparrow lactate, alanine, glycerol,
  - in most cases, ketones and glycerol-3-phosphate.

- molecular analysis on DNA from peripheral leukocytes
- if no mutations found
  - enzymatic activity in a liver biopsy
  - the residual activity may vary from zero to 30% of normal

** Differential Diagnosis
- other disturbances in gluconeogenesis and pyruvate oxidation should be considered, including:
  1) pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency characterised by a low
     lactate/pyruvate ratio, absence of hypoglycaemia and aggravation
     of lactic acidosis by glucose infusion
  2) pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
  3) respiratory chain disorders
  4) glycogenosis type Ia and Ib presenting with the same metabolic profile
     - fasting hypoglycaemia and lactic acidosis and hepato nephromegaly, hyperlipidaemia, and hyperuricaemia
  5) fatty acid oxidation defects presenting with fasting hypoketotic hypoglycaemia and hyperlactataemia

** Treatment

- acute life-threatening episodes should be treated with an IV bolus
  of 20% glucose
- followed by a continuous infusion of glucose and bicarbonate to
  control hypoglycaemia and acidosis.
- Maintenance therapy should be aimed at avoiding fasting,
  particularly during febrile episodes
  - slowly absorbed carbohydrates (uncooked starch), and a gastric
    drip, if necessary.
- absence of any triggering effects leading to metabolic
  decompensation, individuals with FBPase deficiency are healthy and
  no carbohydrate supplements are needed.
