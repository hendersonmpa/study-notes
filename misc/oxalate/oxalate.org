* Primary Hyperoxalouria 
- the three known types of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) are
  - PH1 (due to mutation of AGXT)
  - PH2 (mutation of GRHPR)
  - PH3 (mutation of HOGA1)
- each gene encodes an enzyme for different metabolic pathways
  relevant for the metabolism of glyoxylate
- of the primary hyperoxalurias, approximately
  - 70% PH1
  - 10% PH2
  - 10% PH3
  - 10% do not have an identified genetic cause
- the clinical manifestations of the three known types of
  PH overlap considerably
** Clinical Presentation
- risk for recurrent
  - nephrolithiasis - deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal pelvis and urinary tract
  - nephrocalcinosis - deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal parenchyma
  - end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
- age at onset of symptoms ranges from infancy to the sixth decade
- systemic calcium oxalate deposition (systemic oxalosis) not observed in PH3
** Metabolic Derangement
*** PH1
- deficiency of *liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate-aminotransferase (AGT)*
  - conversion of glyoxylate to glycine
- when AGT activity is absent, glyoxylate is converted to oxalate,
  which forms insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that accumulate in
  the kidney and other organs
*** PH2
- deficiency of  *glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GR/HPR)*
  - reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate, using the cofactor NADH or NADPH
*** PH3
- deficiency of *4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase*
  - conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate to pyruvate and glyoxylate
** Genetics
- PH1 :: AR AGXT
- PH2 :: AR GRHPR
- PH3 :: AR HOGA1
** Diagnostic Tests
- differences in urinary metabolites other than oxalate can provide
  clues regarding the most likely type of PH

  - \uparrow urinary glycolate in PH1 or occasionally in PH3
  - \uparrow urine glycerate in most individuals with PH2
  - \uparrow 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate (HOG) in PH3
    -  undetectable in PH1 and PH2

** Treatment
- \uparrow fluid intake
- alkalinization of urine with potassium citrate
- limit oxalate intake may be helpful
  - oxalate excess is due to endogenous formation
- prevent kidney injury
