* TMA and Choline
** Trimethylamine Metabolism
- trimethylamine (TMA) is a volatile tertiary amine which smells of rotting fish
- a bacterial metabolite which is produced by anaerobes resident
  in the human colon from choline (present in lecithin), carnitine and
  betaine, and from trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in salt water fish and shell-fish
- TMA is absorbed from the intestine and oxidised in the liver by
  flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), a microsomal NADPH-dependent enzyme.
  - product is TMA-N-oxide (TMAO) which is non-odorous and is
    excreted in urine
- more than 90% of the absorbed TMA is oxidised and the urinary output
  of unmetabolised TMA in adults on a Western diet is only around 17-35 umol/24 h
- FMO3 is not produced by the fetus after 15 weeks of gestation or,
  usually, in the first month of life.
- levels increase to around 8% of adult values by nine months of age and 20% by 11 years
- FMO3 activity is inhibited by indoles from brassicas and is reduced perimenstrually

** Catabolism of Choline
- occurs within mitochondria and involves the sequential removal of
  two methyl groups by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) and
  sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH)
- flavin enzymes with covalently linked FAD which use folate as co-factor
- the methyl groups from dimethylglycine and sarcosine are transferred
  to tetrahydrofolate (THF)
  - forming 5,10-methylene THF
- electrons are transferred from FAD \to electron transfer
  flavoprotein (ETF) \to mito ETC

** Trimethylaminuria (Fish Malodour Syndrome)
*** Clinical Presentation
 - TMA is excreted in the breath, sweat, urine and vaginal secretions
 - individuals with trimethylaminuria (TMAU) excrete excessive amounts
   of TMA and when this happens have an unpleasant, pervasive body
   odour of decaying fish
   - Severe TMAU :: null mutation, onset in infancy
   - Mild TMAU :: polymorphisms, adult onset
   - Transient Childhood :: choline supplementation, mild variants, 2\degree to illness

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - FMO3 deficiency
 - TMAU results when the oxidative capacity of FMO3 is overwhelmed by
   TMA substrate

*** Genetics
 - AR, ~1% carrier freq
 - five FMO genes (FMO1-5) and six pseudogenes located in two clusters
   on chromosome 1 (q23-q25)
 - FMO3 is the main isoform of the enzyme in adult liver and the only
   isoform which oxidises TMA

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - common causes of abnormal body odour and urine infection are
   excluded
 - random urine sample is collected if the odour is obvious, if not
   menstruating
 - otherwise, urine is collected after a high choline meal (for example
   two eggs and baked beans) or a 300 g marine fish meal
   - either as a timed 6-8 hour collection, or as a random sample after 2-12 h
 - urine is acidified quickly to pH 2.0 and frozen until analysis
   - NMR spectroscopy or mass spectrometric
   - TMA, TMAO and total TMA
     - normal :: \lt 10%
     - mild :: TMA:total TMAO 10â€“39%
     - severe :: \ge 40% 

*** Treatment
 - \downarrow choline diet
 - \uparrow folate

* Glutathione
- Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide consisting of glutamate, cysteine and glycine
- one of the most important antioxidants also:
  - drug metabolism, free-radical scavenging, biosynthesis of DNA and
    proteins as well as amino acid transport
- synthesized and metabolized in the \gamma-glutamyl cycle
- six enzymes involved in synthesis and turnover
- synthesised from glutamate by sequential actions of
  \gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione
  synthetase
- degradation involves four enzymes
  - \gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase initiates the breakdown by
    catalysing the transfer of its \gamma-glutamyl-group to
    acceptors
  - \gamma-glutamyl residues are substrates of the
    \gamma-glutamyl-cyclotransferase which converts them to
    5-oxoproline and the corresponding amino acids
- Conversion of 5-oxoproline to glutamate is catalysed by
  5-oxoprolinase.
- a dipeptidase splits cysteinylglycine, which is formed in the
  transpeptidation reaction, into glycine and cysteine
- biosynthesis of GSH is feedback regulated
  - GSH inhibits of \gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase
- Genetic defects have been described in five of the six enzymes of
  the \gamma-glutamyl cycle

** Glutathione Synthetase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- classified as mild, moderate or severe
  - mild :: mild hemolytic anemia
  - moderate :: present during the neonatal period, with severe and
                chronic metabolic acidosis, hemolytic anemia, jaundice
                and 5-oxoprolinuria
  - severe :: above plus progressive CNS symptoms

*** Metabolic Derangement
- GS catalyses the last step of GSH synthesis
- deficiency leads to low cellular GSH and excessive production of
  \gamma-glutamylcysteine, the metabolite before the enzyme defect
- \downarrow feedback inhibition of \gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase
  \to \uparrow \gamma-glutamylcysteine
- \gamma-glutamylcysteine \to 5-oxoproline by \gamma-glutamyl
  cyclotransferase
- \Uparrow 5-oxoproline exceeds the capacity of 5-oxoprolinase
- \uparrow 5-oxoproline \to metabolic acidosis and 5-oxoprolinuria

*** Genetics
- AR

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow urine 5-oxoproline
- \downarrow rbc GSH
- \downarrow RBC or fibroblast GS activity
  - 1-30% of normal
- mutation analysis

*** Treatment
- management of GS deficient patients is aimed at correction of
  acidosis, prevention of hemolytic crises and support of endogenous
  defence against reactive oxygen species
- bicarbonate in acute acidosis
- blood trxn for hemolysis
- vitamin E and C
