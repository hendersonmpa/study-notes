* TMA and Choline
** Trimethylamine Metabolism
- trimethylamine (TMA) is a volatile tertiary amine which smells of rotting fish
- bacterial metabolite which is produced by anaerobes in the colon
  from choline (present in lecithin), carnitine, betaine, and from
  trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in marine fish and shellfish
- TMA is absorbed from the intestine and oxidised in the liver by
  flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)
  - product is TMA-N-oxide (TMAO) which is non-odorous and is
    excreted in urine
- \gt 90% of the absorbed TMA is oxidised

** Catabolism of Choline
- choline is an essential nutrient required for synthesis of:
  - choline phospholipids
  - acetyl choline
  - SAM
- catabolism occurs within mitochondria
  - involves the sequential removal of two methyl groups by:
    - dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH)
    - sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH)
  - flavin enzymes with covalently linked FAD which use folate as co-factor
- methyl groups from dimethylglycine and sarcosine are transferred to
  tetrahydrofolate (THF)
  - forming 5,10-methylene THF

** Trimethylaminuria (Fish Malodour Syndrome)
*** Clinical Presentation
 - TMA is excreted in the breath, sweat, urine and vaginal secretions
 - individuals with trimethylaminuria (TMAU) excrete excessive amounts
   of TMA and when this happens have an unpleasant, pervasive body
   odour of decaying fish
   - Severe TMAU :: null mutation, onset in infancy
   - Mild TMAU :: polymorphisms, adult onset
   - Transient Childhood :: choline supplementation, mild variants, 2\degree{} to illness

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - FMO3 deficiency
 - \uparrow urine TMA results when the oxidative capacity of FMO3 is
   overwhelmed by TMA substrate

*** Genetics
 - AR FMO3 ~1% carrier freq

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - common causes of abnormal body odour and UTIs are excluded
 - random urine sample is collected if the odour is obvious and not
   menstruating
 - otherwise urine is collected after a high choline meal (eggs, baked
   beans, marine fish)
 - urine is acidified quickly to pH 2.0 and frozen until analysis
   - NMR spectroscopy or mass spectrometry
   - TMA, TMAO and total TMA
   - \uparrow TMA
   - \downarrow TMAO:TMA

*** Treatment
 - \downarrow choline diet
 - \uparrow folate

* Glutathione
- glutathione is a tripeptide consisting of glutamate, cysteine and
  glycine
- one of the most important antioxidants
  - drug metabolism, free-radical scavenging, biosynthesis of DNA and
    proteins as well as amino acid transport
- synthesized and metabolized in the \gamma-glutamyl cycle (Figure
  [[fig:ggc]])
- six enzymes involved in synthesis and turnover
- synthesised from glutamate by sequential actions of
  \gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione
  synthetase
- degradation involves four enzymes:
  - \gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase initiates the breakdown by
    catalysing the transfer of its \gamma-glutamyl-group to
    acceptors
  - \gamma-glutamyl residues are substrates of the
    \gamma-glutamyl-cyclotransferase which converts them to
    5-oxoproline and the corresponding amino acids
- conversion of 5-oxoproline to glutamate is catalysed by
  5-oxoprolinase
- a dipeptidase splits cysteinylglycine, which is formed in the
  transpeptidation reaction, into glycine and cysteine
- biosynthesis of glutathione is feedback regulated
  - glutathione inhibits of \gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase
- genetic defects have been described in five of the six enzymes of
  the \gamma-glutamyl cycle

** Glutathione Synthetase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- classified as mild, moderate or severe
  - mild :: mild hemolytic anemia
  - moderate :: present during the neonatal period, with severe and
                chronic metabolic acidosis, hemolytic anemia, jaundice
                and 5-oxoprolinuria
  - severe :: above plus progressive CNS symptoms

*** Metabolic Derangement
- *glutathione synthetase (GS)* catalyses the last step of glutathione synthesis
- deficiency \to \downarrow cellular glutathione and \uparrow \gamma-glutamylcysteine
  - due to \downarrow feedback inhibition of \gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase
- \gamma-glutamylcysteine \to 5-oxoproline by \gamma-glutamyl
  cyclotransferase
- \Uparrow 5-oxoproline exceeds the capacity of 5-oxoprolinase
- \uparrow 5-oxoproline \to metabolic acidosis and 5-oxoprolinuria

*** Genetics
- AR GSS

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow urine 5-oxoproline
- \downarrow RBC glutathione
- \downarrow RBC or fibroblast GS activity
  - 1-30% of normal
- mutation analysis
- markers of hemolytic anemia include:
  - \uparrow reticulocytes, an indicator of marrow compensatory response, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of intravascular hemolysis, reduced haptoglobin, and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 
  
*** Treatment
- management of GS deficient patients is aimed at correction of
  acidosis, prevention of hemolytic crises and support of endogenous
  defence against reactive oxygen species
- bicarbonate in acute acidosis
- blood transfusion for hemolysis
- vitamins E and C
