* Introduction
** Trimethylamine Metabolism
- trimethylamine (TMA) is a volatile tertiary amine which smells of rotting fish
- a bacterial metabolite which is produced by anaerobes resident
  in the human colon from choline (present in lecithin), carnitine and
  betaine, and from trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in salt water fish and shell-fish
- TMA is absorbed from the intestine and oxidised in the liver by
  flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), a microsomal NADPH-dependent enzyme.
  - product is TMA-N-oxide (TMAO) which is non-odorous and is
    excreted in urine
- more than 90% of the absorbed TMA is oxidised and the urinary output
  of unmetabolised TMA in adults on a Western diet is only around 17–35 μmol/24 h
- FMO3 is not produced by the fetus after 15 weeks of gestation or,
  usually, in the first month of life.
- levels increase to around 8% of adult values by nine months of age and 20% by 11 years
- FMO3 activity is inhibited by indoles from brassicas and is reduced perimenstrually

** Catabolism of Choline
- occurs within mitochondria and involves the sequential removal of
  two methyl groups by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) and
  sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH)
- flavin enzymes with covalently linked FAD which use folate as co-factor
- The methyl groups from dimethylglycine and sarcosine are transferred to tetrahydrofolate (THF)
  - forming 5,10-methylene THF
- electrons are transferred from FAD \to electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) \to mito ETC
