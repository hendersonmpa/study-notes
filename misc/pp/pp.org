* Purine Metabolism
** Introduction
- Purine nucleotides are involved in energy transfer, metabolic
  regulation, and synthesis of DNA and RNA
- Purine metabolism can be divided into three pathways:
  - biosynthetic pathway, often termed /de novo/
    - starts with the formation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP)
      and leads to the synthesis of IMP
    - IMP interconversions to AMP and GMP
    - go on to di- and triphosphates, to and deoxyribonucleotides
  - catabolic pathway
    - starts from GMP, IMP and AMP
    - produces uric acid , a poorly soluble compound, which tends to
      crystallize once its plasma \ge 0.4 mmol/L
  - salvage pathway
    - utilizes the purine bases guanine, hypoxanthine and adenine
      - provided by food or the catabolic pathway
    - converts them into GMP, IMP and AMP
    - salvage of purine nucleosides, adenosine and guanosine, and
      their deoxy counterparts, catalyzed by kinases, also occurs.
    - also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
      nucleoside analogs into their active forms

- inborn errors of purine metabolism comprise defects or
  superactivities of:

  - purine nucleotide synthesis and interconversions:
    - phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) superactivity and deficiency
    - adenylosuccinase (ADSL) deficiency
    - AICA-ribosiduria caused by ATIC deficiency
  - purine catabolism:
    - muscle AMP deaminase (AMPD, also termed myoadenylate deaminase)
    - adenylate kinase (AK)
    - adenosine deaminase (ADA)
    - purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)
    - xanthine oxidase (XO)
  - purine salvage:
    - hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)
    - adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)
    - adenosine kinase (ADK)
  - deficiency of deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) causes mitochondrial DNA depletion
  - deficiency of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) results in
    less efficient methylation and hence in enhanced toxicity of
    pharmacologic thiopurine ana logs
  - deficiency of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (IT-Pase) also
    increases the toxicity of thiopurines
- With the exception of the deficiencies of muscle AMPD and TPMT, all
  these inborn errors are very rare

** Adenosine Deaminase 1 Deficiency
- two isoforms of adenosine deaminase (ADA)
  - ADA1 is found in most cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages
  - ADA2 is predominant in plasma
*** Clinical Presentation
- clinical spectrum is very broad
  - from a profound impairment of both humoral and cellular immunity
    in infants, known as severe combined immunodeficienc (SCID)
  - to delayed and less severe later onset in older children or
    adults
  - even benign partial ADA1 deficiency in adults
- ~ 80% of patients display, within the first weeks or months after
  birth
- multiple, recurrent opportunistic infections caused by a variety of
  organisms, which rapidly become life-threatening.
- infections are mainly localized in the skin, the respiratory,and the
  gastrointestinal tract
- in affected children over 6 months of age hypoplasia or apparent
  absence of lymphoid tissue (tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus shadow on x-ray)
- nonimmunological symptoms are also found
  - 50% have bone abnormalities
  - cognitive, behavioural, and neurological abnormalities can present
    - lower IQ, hyperactivity, attention deficits, spasticity, head
      lag, nystagmus, inability to focus, and high frequency
      sensorineural deafness

*** Metabolic Derangement
- accumulation in body fluids of adenosine and deoxyadenosine
  - normally nearly undetectable
- these compounds induce the premature death of lymphoid progenitor
  cells, and thereby profoundly impair the generation of T, B, and NK
  lymphocytes.
- ADA deficiency affects to varying extent bone, brain, lung and liver

*** Genetics
- AR, ADA1
  - ~ 40% of SCID

*** Diagnostic Tests
- SCID can be confirmed by relatively simple laboratory tests:
  - lymphopenia involving B, T and natural killer (NK) cells
  - hypogammaglobulinemia
  - IgM deficiency may be detected early
  - IgG deficiency becomes manifest only after the age of 3 months
    when the maternal supply has been exhausted
- the disease is progressive, since residual B- and T-cell function
  which may be found at birth, disappears later on.

- The enzymatic diagnosis is mostly confirmed on red blood cells
- severity of disease correlates with the loss of ADA1 activity:
  - 0-1% activity in children with neonatal onset
  - 1-5% activity in individuals with later onset

*** Treatment
- HSCT
- ERT - PEG-ADA1
- gene therapy

** Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- recurrent infections are usually of later onset
- starting from the end of the first year to up to 5–6 years of age
- initially less severe than in ADA1 deficiency
- 2/3 have neurologic symptoms
  - spastic tetra- or diplegia, ataxia and tremor, and mild to severe
    mental retardation
- 1/3 have autoimmune disorders
  - hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and
    autoimmune neutropenia

*** Metabolic Derangement
- accumulation of four PDP substrates:
  - guanosine, deoxyguanosine, inosine, deoxyinosine
- \downarrow formation of uric acid
- T-cells accumulate dGTP \to impaired immunity
  - dGTP is formed from deoxyguanosine and inhibits ribonucleotide
    reductase, and hence cell division.
- ubiquitous expression of PNP explains the presence of nonimmunologic
  symptoms in its deficiency.

*** Genetics 
- AR

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow plasma uric acid
- \downarrow urine uric acid

- other causes of hypouricemia such as xanthine oxidase deficiency,
  and drug administration (acetylsalicylic acid, thiazide diuretics),
  should be ruled out.
- enzymatic diagnosis of PNP deficiency is usually performed on red
  blood cells

*** Treatment
- bone marrow transplantation
- repeated transfusions of normal, irradiated erythrocytes

** Xanthine Oxidase Deficiency
*** Clinical Picture
- three types of deficiencies of xanthine oxidase
- all cause xanthinuria
  1) type I classi cal xanthinuria
     - caused by isolated XO deficiency
  2) type II classical xanthinuria
     - deficiency of both XO and aldehyde oxidase (AO)
  3) combined deficiency of XO, AO and sulfite oxidase
- type I and type II xanthinuria can be completely asymptomatic
- about 1/3 of cases kidney stones are formed
- myopathy w pain, stiffness

*** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of XO results in the near total replacement of uric acid,
  in plasma and urine, by hypoxanthine and xanthine as the end
  products of purine catabolism
- plasma hypoxanthine is not or minimally elevated
  - due to reutilization by hypoxanthine-guanine phospho-ribosyltransferase
- plasma xanthine \uparrow 10x

- deficiency of AO \to inability to metabolize synthetic purine
  analogues - allopurinol
- The combined deficiency of XO, AO, and SO is caused by failure to
  synthesize a molybdenum cofactor (MoCo), common to the three
  oxidases

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow plasma uric acid
- \downarrow urine uric acid
- \Uparrow plasma xanthine

*** Treatment
- Type I and II XO deficiency are mostly benign
  - \downarrow purine diet w \uparrow fluid intake to prevent renal stones.
- The prognosis of combined XO,AO and SO deficiency improved by daily
  infusion of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP)

** Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase
*** Clinical Presentation
- clinical spectrum of this disorder is very wide and determined by
  the residual activity of the enzyme
- Lesch-Nyhan syndrome = complete or near-complete deficiency of HPRT
- affected children generally appear normal during the first months of
  life.
- at 3 to 6 months of age, a neurological syndrome evolves
  - classified as severe action dystonia, superimposed on a baseline hypotonia.
- Patients develop a striking neuro-psychological profile comprising:
  - compulsive self-destructive behaviour involving biting of their
    fingers and lips
  - physical and verbal aggression
- Speech is hampered by athetoid dysarthria
- most patients have IQ’s around 60–70, some display normal intelligence.
- form uric acid stones.
- if untreated, the uric acid nephrolithiasis progresses to
  obstructive uropathy and renal failure during the first decade of
  life

*** Metabolic Derangement
- \Uparrow production of uric acid due to \uparrow /de novo/ synthesis
  - caused by \uparrow PRPP, which is not recycled by HPRT

*** Genetic
- XLR, HPRT

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow urine and plasma uric acid
  - uric acid/creatinine
- patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome display nearly undetectable
  HPRT activity in red blood cells

*** Treatment and Prognosis
- allopurinol prevents urate nephropathy.
  - even when given from birth or in combination with adenine has no
    effect on the neurological symptoms

* Pyrimidine Metabolism
** Introduction
- metabolism of the pyrimidine nucleotides can be divided into three
  pathways:
  1) biosynthetic /de novo/ pathway:
     - starts with the formation of carbamoylphosphate by cytosolic
       carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS II)
     - followed by the synthesis of UMP, CMP and TMP
  2) catabolic pathway:
     - starts from CMP, UMP and TMP
     - yields \beta-alanine and \beta-aminoisobutyrate
     - converted into intermediates of TCA cycle
  3) salvage pathway:
     - composed of kinases
     - converts pyrimidine nucleosides, cytidine, uridine, and
       thymidine \to CMP, UMP, and TMP
     - also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
       nucleoside analogs into their active forms

- inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism comprise defects of:
  - pyrimidine synthesis:
    - CAD, UMP synthase deficiency and Miller syndrome
  - pyrimidine catabolism:
    - deficiencies of dihydropyrimidine
      dehydrogenase (DPD) dihydropyrimidinase (DHP)
    - ureidopropionase, thymidine phosphorylase
    - pyrimidine 5’-nucleotidase and cytidine deaminase
    - super-activity of cytosolic 5’-nucleotidase
  - pyrimidine salvage:
    - thymidine kinase 2 deficiency

** UMP Synthase Deficiency 
- AKA: Hereditary Orotic Aciduria
*** Clinical Presentation
- megaloblastic anaemia a few weeks or months after birth
  - usually the first manifestation
- peripheral blood smears often show anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and
  moderate hypochromia
- bone marrow examination reveals erythroid hyperplasia and numerous
  megaloblastic erythroid precursors
- characteristically, the anemia does not respond to iron, folic acid
  or vitamin B 12
- unrecognized, the disorder leads to FTT and to retardation of growth
  and psychomotor development

*** Metabolic Derangement

- UMP synthase is a bifunctional enzyme of the /de novo/ synthesis of
  pyrimidines
- first reaction, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT),converts
  orotic acid into OMP
- second, orotidine-5’-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC),
  decarboxylates OMP into UMP
- deficiency \to massive overproduction of orotic acid
  - due to \downarrow feedback inhibition exerted by the pyrimidine
    nucleotides on the first enzyme of their /de novo synthesis/ CPS2
    and deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides
- \downarrow pyrimidine nucleotides \to \downarrow cell division \to megaloblastic anemia

*** Genetics
- AR, UMPS

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow urine orotic acid, 200-1000X

*** Treatment
- enzyme defect can be by-passed by the administration of uridine
  - converted into UMP by uridine kinase

** Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- two forms:
  1. infantile, severe
     - epilepsy, motor and mental retardation
     - hypertonia, hyperreflexia, growth delay, microcephaly, autistic features
  2. adult, partial
     - found in adults who receive pyrimidine analog, 5-fluorouracil
       - 5-fluorouracil used to treat cancers including breast, ovary colon
     - evere toxicity, manifested by profound neutropenia, stomatitis,
       diarrhea and neurologic symptoms, including ataxia, paralysis
       and stupor

*** Metabolic Derangement
- DPD catalyzes the catabolism of uracil and thymine \to dihydrouracil
  and dihydrothymine
- accumulation of uracil and thymine

*** Genetics
- AR, DPD for infantile form
- adult form found in certain heterozygotes
  - IVS14+1G>A

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow urine uracil
- \Uparrow urine thyamine
- Enzyme activity in fibroblasts, liver and blood cells, with the
  exception of erythrocytes

*** Treatment 
- Infantile: None
- Adult: avoid 5-fluorouracil
