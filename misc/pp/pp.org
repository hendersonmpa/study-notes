* Purine Metabolism
** Introduction
- purine nucleotides are involved in energy transfer, metabolic
  regulation, and synthesis of DNA and RNA
- purine metabolism can be divided into three pathways:
  - biosynthetic pathway often termed /de novo/
    - starts with the formation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP)
      and leads to the synthesis of IMP
    - IMP interconversions to AMP and GMP
      - \to di- and triphosphates and deoxyribonucleotides
  - catabolic pathway
    - starts from GMP, IMP and AMP
    - produces uric acid , a poorly soluble compound, which tends to
      crystallize once its plasma \ge 0.4 mmol/L
  - salvage pathway
    - utilizes the purine bases guanine, hypoxanthine and adenine
      - provided by food or the catabolic pathway
    - converts them into GMP, IMP and AMP
    - also salvage of purine nucleosides, adenosine and guanosine, and
      their deoxy counterparts, catalyzed by kinases
    - also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
      nucleoside analogs into their active forms

- inborn errors of purine metabolism comprise defects or
  superactivities of:

  - purine nucleotide synthesis and interconversion
    - phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) superactivity and deficiency
    - adenylosuccinase (ADSL) deficiency
    - AICA-ribosiduria caused by ATIC deficiency
  - purine catabolism
    - muscle AMP deaminase (AMPD, also termed myoadenylate deaminase)
    - adenylate kinase (AK)
    - adenosine deaminase (ADA)
    - purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)
    - xanthine oxidase (XO)
  - purine salvage
    - hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)
    - adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)
    - adenosine kinase (ADK)
  - deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) deficiency causes mitochondrial DNA depletion
  - thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency results in less
    efficient methylation
    - \therefore enhanced toxicity of pharmacologic thiopurine analogs
  - inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (IT-Pase) deficiency
    increases the toxicity of thiopurines
- with the exception of the deficiencies of muscle AMPD and TPMT, all
  these inborn errors are very rare

** Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate Synthetase Superactivity
*** Clinical Presentation
- gouty arthritis and/or uric acid lithiasis in young males

*** Metabolic Derangement
- PRPP is the first intermediate in /de novo/ synthesis of purine nucleotides
\ce{ribose-5-phosphate + ATP ->[PRPS] PRPP}
- PRPP synthetase is highly regulated
- two proposed mechanisms to explain PRPS1 superactivity
  1. gain-of-function point mutations in the PRPS1 gene resulting in an
     altered regulatory site
  2. \uparrow expression of PRPS1 with normal kinetic properties
- PRPP amidotransferase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the
  /de novo/ pathway
  - \uparrow purine synthesis to \uparrow uric acid

*** Genetics
- X-linked, PRPS1

*** Diagnostic Tests
- extensive kinetic studies of the enzyme in erythrocytes and cultured
  fibroblasts is performed in only a few laboratories in the world
- molecular testing of PRPS1 gene

*** Treatment
- treated with allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, the last
  enzyme of purine catabolism
- results in a decrease of the production of uric acid and in its
  replacement by
  - hypoxanthine which is about 10-fold more soluble
  - xanthine which is slightly more soluble

** Muscle Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase 1 Deficiency
- AKA myoadenylate deaminase deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- present in 1-2% of the Caucasian population
- majority asymptomatic
- muscular weakness, fatigue, cramps or myalgias following moderate to
  vigorous exercise
- patients may display a gradual progression of their symptoms
  - dressing and walking a few steps lead to fatigue and myalgias
- sometimes accompanied by an increase in serum creatine kinase, myoglobinuria and minor electromyographic
  abnormalities

*** Metabolic Derangement
- AMPD, adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinase form the
  purine nucleotide cycle
\ce{AMP + H2O ->[AMD1] IMP + NH3}

*** Genetics
- AR AMPD1

*** Diagnostic Tests
- NIET
  - several-fold elevation of venous plasma ammonia, seen in normal
    subjects, is absent in AMPD deficiency

***  Treatment
- ribose reported to improve muscular strength and endurance 
** Adenosine Deaminase 1 Deficiency
- two isoforms of adenosine deaminase (ADA)
  - ADA1 is found in most cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages
  - ADA2 is predominant in plasma
*** Clinical Presentation
- clinical spectrum is very broad
  - from a profound impairment of both humoral and cellular immunity
    in infants, known SCID
  - to delayed and less severe later onset in older children or
    adults
  - even benign partial ADA1 deficiency in adults
- ~ 80% of patients present within the first weeks or months after
  birth
- recurrent opportunistic infections caused by a variety of organisms,
  which rapidly become life-threatening
- infections are mainly localized in the skin, the respiratory, and the
  gastrointestinal tract
- \gt 6 months develop hypoplasia or apparent absence of lymphoid
  tissue (tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus shadow on x-ray)
- non-immunological symptoms are also found
  - 50% have bone abnormalities
  - cognitive, behavioural, and neurological abnormalities can present
    - lower IQ, hyperactivity, attention deficits, spasticity, head
      lag, nystagmus, inability to focus, and high frequency
      sensorineural deafness
- disease is progressive since residual B and T-cell function which
  may be found at birth disappear later on
*** Metabolic Derangement
- accumulation in body fluids of adenosine and deoxyadenosine
  - normally ~undetectable
\ce{adenosine + H2O ->[ADA1] inosine + NH3}
- \to premature death of lymphoid progenitor cells
- \therefore impair generation of T, B, and NK lymphocytes
- ADA deficiency affects to varying extent bone, brain, lung and liver

*** Genetics
- AR, ADA1
  - ~ 40% of SCID

*** Diagnostic Tests
- SCID can be confirmed by relatively simple laboratory tests:
  - lymphopenia involving B, T and natural killer (NK) cells
  - hypogammaglobulinemia
  - IgM deficiency may be detected early
  - IgG deficiency becomes manifest only after the age of 3 months
    when the maternal supply has been exhausted
- enzymatic diagnosis is mostly confirmed on red blood cells
- severity of disease correlates with the loss of ADA1 activity:
  - 0-1% activity in children with neonatal onset
  - 1-5% activity in individuals with later onset

*** Treatment
- HSCT
- ERT with PEG-ADA1
- gene therapy

** Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- recurrent infections are usually of later onset
- starting from the end of the first year to up to 5-6 years of age
- initially less severe than in ADA1 deficiency
- 2/3 have neurologic symptoms
  - spastic tetra- or diplegia, ataxia and tremor, and mild to severe
    mental retardation
- 1/3 have autoimmune disorders
  - hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and
    autoimmune neutropenia

*** Metabolic Derangement
- accumulation of four PDP substrates:
  - guanosine, deoxyguanosine, inosine, deoxyinosine
\ce{purine nucleoside + phosphate ->[PNP] purine + \alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate}
- \downarrow formation of uric acid
- T-cells accumulate dGTP \to impaired immunity
  - dGTP is formed from deoxyguanosine and inhibits ribonucleotide
    reductase, and hence cell division.
- ubiquitous expression of PNP explains the presence of nonimmunologic
  symptoms in its deficiency

*** Genetics 
- AR, PNP 

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow plasma uric acid
- \downarrow urine uric acid
  - other causes of hypouricemia such as xanthine oxidase deficiency,
    and drug administration (acetylsalicylic acid, thiazide diuretics),
    should be ruled out
- RBC enzyme activity

*** Treatment
- bone marrow transplantation
- repeated transfusions of irradiated erythrocytes

** Xanthine Oxidase Deficiency
*** Clinical Picture
- three types of deficiencies of xanthine oxidase, all cause
  xanthinuria
  1) type I classical xanthinuria
     - isolated XO deficiency
  2) type II classical xanthinuria
     - XO and aldehyde oxidase (AO) deficiency
  3) molybdenum cofactor deficiency
     - combined deficiency of XO, AO and sulfite oxidase
- type I and type II xanthinuria can be completely asymptomatic
- \sim 1/3 of cases \to kidney stones
- myopathy w pain stiffness

*** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of XO results in the near total replacement of uric acid,
  in plasma and urine, by hypoxanthine and xanthine as the end
  products of purine catabolism
  - \ce{hypoxanthine + H2O + O2 ->[XO] xanthine + H2O2}
  - \ce{xanthine + H2O + O2 ->[XO] uric acid + H2O2}
- plasma hypoxanthine is not or minimally elevated
  - due to reutilization by hypoxanthine-guanine phospho-ribosyltransferase
- plasma xanthine \uparrow 10x
- deficiency of AO \to inability to metabolize synthetic purine
  analogues - allopurinol
- combined XO, AO, and SO deficiency is caused molybdenum cofactor
  (MoCo) deficiency (see Sulfur Amino Acids)

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow plasma uric acid
- \downarrow urine uric acid
- \Uparrow plasma xanthine

*** Treatment
- type I and II XO deficiency are mostly benign
  - \downarrow purine diet w \uparrow fluid intake to prevent renal stones
- prognosis of combined XO,AO and SO deficiency improved by daily
  infusion of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP)

** Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase
*** Clinical Presentation
- *Lesch-Nyhan syndrome* = complete or near-complete deficiency of HPRT
- clinical spectrum is very wide and determined by residual enzyme activity
- affected children generally appear normal during the first months of
  life
- \sim 3-6 months a neurological syndrome evolves
  - classified as severe action dystonia, superimposed on a baseline hypotonia
- patients develop a striking neuro-psychological profile comprising:
  - compulsive self-destructive behaviour involving biting of their
    fingers and lips
  - physical and verbal aggression
- speech is hampered by athetoid dysarthria
- most patients have IQâ€™s around 60-70, some display normal intelligence
- form uric acid stones
- if untreated, the uric acid nephrolithiasis progresses to
  obstructive uropathy and renal failure during the first decade of
  life

*** Metabolic Derangement
- hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency
\ce{hypoxanthine + quanine + PRPP->[HPRT] IMP + GMP}
- transfers the 5-phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphoribosyl
  1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to the purine
- HGPRT plays a central role in the generation of purine nucleotides
  through the purine salvage pathway
- \uparrow PRPP \to \Uparrow production of uric acid
  - due to \uparrow /de novo/ purine synthesis

*** Genetic
- *XLR*, HPRT

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow urine and plasma uric acid
  - uric acid/creatinine
-  RBC HPRT activity is nearly undetectable

*** Treatment and Prognosis
- allopurinol prevents urate nephropathy
  - even when given from birth or in combination with adenine has no
    effect on the neurological symptoms

* Pyrimidine Metabolism
** Introduction
- metabolism of the pyrimidine nucleotides can be divided into three
  pathways:
  1) biosynthetic /de novo/ pathway:
     - starts with the formation of carbamoylphosphate by cytosolic
       carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS II)
     - followed by the synthesis of UMP, CMP and TMP
  2) catabolic pathway:
     - starts from CMP, UMP and TMP
     - yields \beta-alanine and \beta-aminoisobutyrate
     - converted into intermediates of TCA cycle
  3) salvage pathway:
     - composed of kinases
     - converts pyrimidine nucleosides, cytidine, uridine, and
       thymidine \to CMP, UMP, and TMP
     - also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
       nucleoside analogs into their active forms

- inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism comprise defects of:
  - pyrimidine synthesis:
    - CAD (carbamoylphosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase) Deficiency
    - UMP synthase deficiency
    - Miller syndrome
  - pyrimidine catabolism:
    - deficiencies of dihydropyrimidine
      dehydrogenase (DPD) dihydropyrimidinase (DHP)
    - ureidopropionase, thymidine phosphorylase
    - pyrimidine 5â€™-nucleotidase and cytidine deaminase
    - super-activity of cytosolic 5â€™-nucleotidase
  - pyrimidine salvage:
    - thymidine kinase 2 deficiency

** UMP Synthase Deficiency 
- AKA: Hereditary Orotic Aciduria
*** Clinical Presentation
- megaloblastic anaemia a few weeks or months after birth
  - usually the first manifestation
- peripheral blood smears often show anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and
  moderate hypochromia
- bone marrow examination reveals erythroid hyperplasia and numerous
  megaloblastic erythroid precursors
- characteristically, the anemia does not respond to iron, folic acid
  or vitamin B_{12}
- untreated disorder leads to FTT and retardation of growth and
  psychomotor development

*** Metabolic Derangement
- UMP synthase is a bifunctional enzyme of the /de novo/ synthesis of
  pyrimidines
- first domain orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) converts
  orotic acid into OMP
- second domain orotidine-5â€™-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC)
  decarboxylates OMP into UMP
\ce{orotic ->[UMPS] OMP ->[UMPS] UMP}
- deficiency \to massive overproduction of orotic acid
  - due to \downarrow feedback inhibition exerted by the pyrimidine
    nucleotides on the first enzyme of their /de novo/ synthesis CPS2
    and deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides
- \downarrow pyrimidine nucleotides \to \downarrow cell division \to
  megaloblastic anemia

*** Genetics
- AR, UMPS

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow urine orotic acid, 200-1000X

*** Treatment
- enzyme defect can be by-passed by the administration of uridine
  - converted into UMP by uridine kinase

** Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- two forms:
  1. infantile, severe
     - epilepsy, motor and mental retardation
     - hypertonia, hyperreflexia, growth delay, microcephaly, autistic features
  2. adult, partial
     - found in adults who receive pyrimidine analog, 5-fluorouracil
       - 5-fluorouracil used to treat cancers including breast, ovary, colon
     - severe toxicity, manifested by profound neutropenia, stomatitis,
       diarrhea and neurologic symptoms, including ataxia, paralysis
       and stupor

*** Metabolic Derangement
- DPD catalyzes the catabolism of uracil and thymine \to dihydrouracil
  and dihydrothymine
  - accumulation of uracil and thymine

*** Genetics
- AR, DPYD 

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow urine uracil
- \Uparrow urine thyamine
- enzyme activity in fibroblasts, liver and blood cells, with the
  exception of erythrocytes

*** Treatment 
- infantile: none
- adult: avoid 5-fluorouracil
