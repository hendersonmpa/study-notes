* Introduction
- Porphyria is a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the
   chemical steps that lead to heme production
- Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs, although it is
   most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver
- Heme is a component of several iron-containing proteins called
   hemoproteins, including hemoglobin and the cytochrome P450 family of
   enzymes

- Porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles composed of four modified
   pyrrole subunits
- interconnected at their \alpha-carbon atoms via methine bridges
   (=CHâˆ’)
- Porphyrins are aromatic
- Thus porphyrin macrocycles are highly conjugated systems
- As a result they typically have very intense absorption bands in the
   visible region and may be deeply colored
- the name "porphyrin" comes from a Greek word for purple
  
- Form complexes with metal ions
   - Iron :: Heme
   - Magnesium :: Chlorophyll
- Binds in hemoglobin
- The highly reactive binds to the CYP450 heme iron
- The CYP450 enzyme oxidizes substrates by transfer of the oxygen atom
- Porphyrias can therefore lead to a wide variety of symptoms and
   clinical manifestations

- RBC free protoporphyrin :: \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow

** Acute Porphyrias (Table [[tbl:onset]])
- *ADP, AIP, VP, HCP*
- Low clinical penetrance is a promenent feature of all AD acute porphyrias
- 25% of patients with overt acute porphyria have no family history
  + sporadic presentation reflects high prevalence and low penetrance
  + acute porphyria caused by de novo mutation is uncommon
- Allelic heterogenetity
*** Clinical Features
- Life threatening neuroviseral attack occur in AIP,VP and HCP
  are clinically identical

- persistent psychiatric illness is not a feature of acute porphyrias.
  - disappears with remission
**** Precipitating factors
1) drugs
2) alcohol, especially binge drinking
3) the menstrual cycle
4) calorie restriction
5) infection
6) stress
**** Drugs
- barbiturates, sulfonamides, progestogens, anticonvulsants
- http://www.drugs-porphyria.org
**** Long term complications
- chronic renal failure
- hypertension
- primary hepatocellular carcinoma

** Non-acute Porphyrias (Table [[tbl:onset]])
- *PCT, CEP, EPP*
*** PCT
- *UROD*
- most common, 2-5/million in UK
- both sexes
- onset during 5th and sixth decade
**** Clincal features
- lesions on sun-exposed skin
  - back of hands
  - forearm
  - face
- fragile skin
- subepidermal bullae, milia, hypertrichosis of the face, patchy pigmentation
- \uparrow LFTs in 50%
- Skin lesions with liver damage associated with:
  - alcohol abuse
  - estrogens
  - infection with heptotropic viruses, HCV
  - hemochromatosis, iron overload
**** Pathogenesis and Molecular Genetics
- \downarrow activity of UROD in liver \to \uparrow URO
- 50% \downarrow in UROD activity does not \to overt PCT
  - further inactivation in the liver is required
- 80% of patients have sporadic (type I)
  - enzyme defect is restricted to the liver
  - typically no family history
- Famillial (type II)
  - mutation in one UROD gene \to 1/2 normal activity
- Exposure to polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons
**** Treatment
- \downarrow exposure to light
- iron depletion
- chloroquine
*** CEP
- *UROS*
- least common, most severe of the cutaneous porphyrias.
  - < 1:million in UK
**** Clinical Features
- Varying severity
  - hydrops fetalis
  - onset in infancy of severe skin lesions, transfusion dependent
    hemolytic anemia
  - mid-life onset of mild skin lesions resembling PCT
- Most present in early infancy
  - blisters on skin after UV exposure
  - reb-brown staining of diapers by urinary porphyrins
- Ongoing destruction of ears, nose and eyelids, alopecia
- red brown teeth
- Skin changes usually accompanied by hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly
**** Pathogenesis and Molecular Genetics
- Autosomal recessive, mutations in UROS or rarely GATA1
- \downarrow UROS \to \uparrow UI
- usually heteroallelic
**** Treatment
- \downarrow UV exposure
- curative treatment - allogenic bone marrow transplantation
- investigating gene therapy

*** EPP
- *FECH*
- X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP)
  - 2% of EPP cases
  - due to gain of function *ALAS2* mutation
- life long acute photosensitivity due to \uparrow protoporphyrin-IX
  in the skin
- Absence of fragile skin, subepidermal bullae, and hypertrichosis
  distinguishes it from all other cutaneous porphyrias.

**** Clinical Features
- acute photosensitivity
- onset birth \to age 6, median = 1 year
- both sexes
- onset after 40 very rare
  - most cases associated with myelodysplasia, caused by aquired
    somatic mutation of FECH.
- Most severe complication is progressive hepatic failure
- Cholelithiasis - gallstones promoted by \uparrow protoporphyri in bile
- mild microcytic anemia

**** Molecular Pathology and Genetics
- \uparrow protoporphyrin mainly in bone marrow
- FECH mutation is autosomal recessive
- compound heterozygotes
- Threshold FECH activity = 35% \to \uparrow protoporphyrin.
- see XLDPP above
**** Treatment
- avoid sunlight
- annual LFTs
- orthotopic liver transplantation
- bone marrow transplantation

** Abnormalities of Porphyrin Metabolism not caused by Porphyria
- More common cause of abnormal porphyrin metabolism than porphyria.
*** Lead and Other Heavy Metals
- Lead exposure \uparrow urinary ALA and coproporphyrin III excretion
  and accumulation of ZN-protoporphyrin in erythrocytes
  - inhibition of ALAD, CPOX
  - Pb causes mito deficiency in Fe \to Zn replaces Fe as
    substrate for FECH
  - \uparrow ALA excretion secondary to inhibition of ALAD
    - caused by lead displacing zinc at catalytic site
    - ALAD2 isoform more susceptible than ALAD1
*** Secondary Coproporphyrinuria: Hepatobiliary and other Disorders
- Most common cause of abnormal porphyrin excretion
  - alcohol intake :: CIII
  - impaired biliary excretion of CI :: \to urine
    - cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and cirrhosis
    - reversal of normal ratio: CI dominates
    - drugs
    - severe infection
  - Dubin-Johnson :: \uparrow CI, \downarrow CII
  - Rotor :: \uparrow CI, normal CIII
  - Gilbert :: \uparrow CI, \uparrow CIII

*** Increased Fecal Porphyrin Concentration
- Protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins derived from
  bacterial metabolism.
- Additional protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins formed
  from heme containing proteins from diet or gastrointestinal
  hemorrhage.
- Even minor hemorrhage (ie FOBT negative) \uparrow dicarboxylic porphyrins.
- Confusion with EPP may occur when associated iron deficiency
  \uparrow erythrocyte total porphyrin, and skin lesions for other reasons.
- Confusion with VP when coexisting liver disease causes
  Coproporphyrinuria.
- Porphyria is excluded when no porphyrin fluorescence is detectable
  on fluorescenceq emission spectroscopy of plasma and fecal
  coproporphyrin excretion is normal.
- Consumption of Brewers yeast caused profile indistinguishable from
  VP.

*** Increase Plasma Porphyrin Concentration: Renal and other Disorders
- Plasma Porphyrin concentration increased due to \downarrow renal or
  hepatobiliary excretion is impaired.
- ESRF marked increase in concentration, poor clearance by dialysis
  - Similar to PCT, but not as high
  - PCT uncommon complicaiton of ESRF
  - Distinguish with fecal porphyrin analysis
*** Hematologic Disorders
- iron deficiency anemia, Zn acts as alternate substrate for FECH
  - results in \uparrow erythrocyte ZPP
  - also sideroblastic megaloblastic, and hemolytic anemias
*** Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type I

* Diagnostic Tests
** Laboratory Tests in an Acute Attack
- Acute attacks should have excess urinary excretion of or both.
- Patients with cutaneous symptoms (VP,HCP) should also have excessive
  production of porphyrins
- *Genetic and/or enzyme studies are rarely helpful for diagnosis*
- Urine should be *markedly elevated*
  - Use a fresh RANDOM specimen, protect from light
- During an acute attack, *a normal PBG essentially excludes all acute
  neuro-visceral porphyrias* (except ADP).
- When suspicion of an acute porphyria remains high while crisis is
  resolving
  - analysis of fecal and plasma porphyrins and urinary ALA is
    advisable even if PBG is normal
- *NB: Elevated PBG and ALA doesn't mean symptoms are caused by AIP*
- Watson-Schwartz Test for PBG
  - Urine is passed sequentially through an anion exchange column which
    retains PBG and a cation exchange column which retains ALA.
  - Ehrlich's reagent is used to detect indoles and pyrroles.
