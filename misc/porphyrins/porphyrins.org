* Introduction
- porphyria is a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the
   chemical steps that lead to heme production
- heme is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver
- heme is a component of several iron-containing proteins called
  hemoproteins, including hemoglobin and the cytochrome P450 family of
  enzymes
- porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles composed of four modified
   pyrrole subunits
- interconnected at their \alpha-carbon atoms via methine bridges
   (=CHâˆ’)
- typically have very intense absorption bands in the visible region
  and may be deeply colored
- biosynthesis:
  - organelle: mitochondria \to cytoplasm \to mitochondria
    - starts with succinyl-CoA and glycine in mitochondria
  - tissue: 70-80% in bone marrow
    - 15% in other tissue ie. liver \to Cyto P450, cytochromes

* Acute Porphyrias 
** Clinical Features 
- life threatening neuroviseral attack occur in AIP,VP and HCP
  are clinically identical
- low clinical penetrance is a promenent feature of all AD acute porphyrias
- 25% of patients with overt acute porphyria have no family history
  - sporadic presentation reflects high prevalence and low penetrance
  - acute porphyria caused by /de novo/ mutation is uncommon
- allelic heterogenetity

- persistent psychiatric illness is not a feature of acute porphyrias.
  - disappears with remission
*** Precipitating factors
1) drugs
2) alcohol, especially binge drinking
3) the menstrual cycle
4) calorie restriction
5) infection
6) stress
*** Drugs
- barbiturates, sulfonamides, progestogens, anticonvulsants
- http://www.drugs-porphyria.org
*** Long term complications
- chronic renal failure
- hypertension
- primary hepatocellular carcinoma

** Metabolic Derangement
*** ALA Dehydratase Porphyria 
 - *aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)* 
   - aka: porphobilinogen synthase
   - requires zinc, inhibited by lead
   - ~five cases reported
     - Urine ALA :: \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
     - Urine PBG :: Not elevated

*** Acute Intermittent Porphyria
 - *hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS)* 
 - aka: PBG deaminase
 - four PBGs are combined through deamination
 - susceptible to allosteric inhibition by CIII and protoporphyrinogen
 - HMB is unstable \to \uparrow URO I
   - Urine PBG :: \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
   - Urine ALA :: \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
 - rule out VP and HCP
 - \uparrow urine uroporphyrin arises from non-enzymatic
   condensation of micro-molar concentrations of PBG

*** Hereditary Coproporphyria
 - *coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX)*
 - mitochondrial inter-membrane space
 - inhibited by metals
 - specific for CIII
   - Urine PBG :: \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
   - Fecal copro III :: \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow

*** Varigate Porphyria
 - *Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase (PPOX)*
 - inner mitochondrial membrane
 - Urine PBG :: \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
   - Fecal copro-III :: \uparrow \uparrow
   - Plasma fluorescence scan :: \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
   
** Genetics
- ALAD :: AR ALAD
- AIP :: AD HMBS
- VP :: AD PPOX with reduced penetrance
- HCP :: AD CPOX
** Diagnostic Tests
*** Acute Attack
 - during an acute attack *a normal PBG essentially excludes all acute
   neuro-visceral porphyrias*
   - except ADP
 - patients with cutaneous symptoms (VP, HCP) should also have excessive
   production of porphyrins
 - when suspicion of an acute porphyria remains high while crisis is
   resolving
   - analysis of fecal and plasma porphyrins and urinary ALA is
     advisable even if PBG is normal
 - elevated PBG and ALA doesn't mean symptoms are caused by AIP
 - genetic and/or enzyme studies are rarely helpful for diagnosis

*** Non-AIP Acute Porphyrias
 - VP and HCP may not have skin lesions \to fecal porphyrins
   - if normal, w \uparrow PBG, VP & HCP are excluded \to AIP
   - if \uparrow total fecal porphyrins \to fractionate by HPLC
     - HCP :: coproporphyrin-III \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
     - VP :: protoporphyrin-IX \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow
   - can also be due to diet or GI bleed
   - follow-up with plasma porphyrin emission scan
** Treatment
- acute
  - IV glucose, hematin
- avoid triggers
  - adverse drugs
  - hypoglycemia
  - smoking, drinking
  - progesterone 

* Non-Acute Porphyrias 
** X-Linked Sideroblastic Anemia
- *\Delta-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2)*
- X-linked ALAS2
- mitochondrial
- rate limiting step under normal conditions
- microcytic, hypochromic red cells
- abnormal accumulation of iron in red blood cells \to ring
  sideroblasts
** Porphyria Cutanea Tarda
*** Clinical Presentation
- both sexes
- most common porphyria
- onset during 5th and sixth decade
- lesions on sun-exposed skin: back of hands, forearm, face
- fragile skin
- subepidermal bullae, milia, hypertrichosis of the face, patchy pigmentation
- skin lesions with liver damage associated with:
  - alcohol abuse
  - estrogens
  - infection with heptotropic viruses, HCV
  - hemochromatosis, iron overload
*** Metabolic Derangement
- *uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD)* 
- last cytoplasmic enzyme, \downarrow polar
- \downarrow activity of UROD in liver \to \uparrow URO
- 50% \downarrow in UROD activity does not \to overt PCT
  - further inactivation in the liver is required
- 80% of patients have sporadic (type I)
  - enzyme defect is restricted to the liver
  - typically no family history
- \uparrow LFTs in 50%
- hepta, hexa and pentacarboxylate formed at the same active site
- \downarrow UROD \to increase in intermediates and uroporphyrins
*** Genetics
- famillial PCT
  - AD UROD w reduced penetrance
  - mutation in one UROD gene \to 1/2 normal activity
- acquired PCT 
  - exposure to polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons
*** Diagnostic Tests
- urine porphyrin quantitation
  - \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow Uro I & III
*** Treatment
- \downarrow exposure to light
- iron depletion
- chloroquine
** Congential Erythropoietic Porphyria
*** Clinical Presentation
- varying severity
  - hydrops fetalis
  - onset in infancy of severe skin lesions, transfusion dependent
    hemolytic anemia
  - mid-life onset of mild skin lesions resembling PCT
- most present in early infancy
  - blisters on skin after UV exposure
  - red-brown staining of diapers by urinary porphyrins
- ongoing destruction of ears, nose and eyelids, alopecia
- red brown teeth
- skin changes usually accompanied by hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly
*** Metabolic Derangement
- *uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS)* 
- \downarrow UROS \to \uparrow UI
  - HMB condensed \to Uro I or III
  - HMB \rightarrow Uro I: spontaneous
  - HMB \rightarrow Uro III: UROS
*** Genetics
- least common, most severe of the cutaneous porphyrias, < 1:million in UK
- AR UROS
  - usually heteroallelic
- X-linked GATA1 very rare
  - a transcription factor
*** Diagnostic tests
- urine porphyrin quantitation
    - \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow Uro I
    - \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow  Copro I
- fecal porphyrin quantitation
    - \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow Copro I

*** Treatment
- \downarrow UV exposure
- curative treatment - allogenic bone marrow transplantation
- investigating gene therapy

** Erythropoietic Protoporphyria
*** Clinical Features
- life long acute photosensitivity due to \uparrow protoporphyrin-IX
  in the skin
- onset birth \to age 6, median = 1 year
- both sexes
- onset after 40 very rare
  - most cases associated with myelodysplasia, caused by aquired
    somatic mutation of FECH.
- absence of fragile skin, subepidermal bullae, and hypertrichosis
  distinguishes it from all other cutaneous porphyrias
- most severe complication is progressive hepatic failure
- cholelithiasis - gallstones promoted by \uparrow protoporphyri in bile
- mild microcytic anemia

*** Metabolic Derangement
- *ferrochelatase (FECH)* 
- threshold FECH activity = 35% \to \uparrow protoporphyrin
  - inserts ferrous iron into protoporphyrin to form heme
  - aka: heme synthase
  - in iron deficient states forms \to zinc protoporphyrin
- \uparrow protoporphyrin mainly in bone marrow

*** Genetics 
- AR FECH 
- X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP)
  - 2% of EPP cases
  - due to gain of function ALAS2 mutation

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow \Uparrow \Uparrow RBC free protoporphyrin

*** Treatment
- avoid sunlight
- annual LFTs
- orthotopic liver transplantation
- bone marrow transplantation

* Secondary Causes
- more common cause of abnormal porphyrin metabolism than porphyria
** Lead and Other Heavy Metals
- lead exposure \uparrow urinary ALA and coproporphyrin III excretion
  and accumulation of ZN-protoporphyrin in erythrocytes
  - inhibition of ALAD, CPOX
  - Pb causes mito deficiency in Fe \to Zn replaces Fe as
    substrate for FECH
  - \uparrow ALA excretion secondary to inhibition of ALAD
    - caused by lead displacing zinc at catalytic site
    - ALAD2 isoform more susceptible than ALAD1
** Secondary Coproporphyrinuria: Hepatobiliary and other Disorders
- most common cause of abnormal porphyrin excretion
  - alcohol intake :: CIII
  - impaired biliary excretion of CI :: \to urine
    - cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and cirrhosis
    - reversal of normal ratio: CI dominates
    - drugs
    - severe infection
  - Dubin-Johnson :: \uparrow CI, \downarrow CII
  - Rotor :: \uparrow CI, normal CIII
  - Gilbert :: \uparrow CI, \uparrow CIII

** Increased Fecal Porphyrin Concentration
- protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins derived from
  bacterial metabolism
- additional protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins formed
  from heme containing proteins from diet or gastrointestinal
  hemorrhage
- even minor hemorrhage (ie FOBT negative) \uparrow dicarboxylic porphyrins
- confusion with EPP may occur when associated iron deficiency
  \uparrow erythrocyte total porphyrin, and skin lesions for other reasons
- Confusion with VP when coexisting liver disease causes
  coproporphyrinuria
- porphyria is excluded when no porphyrin fluorescence is detectable
  on fluorescence emission spectroscopy of plasma and fecal
  coproporphyrin excretion is normal
- consumption of brewers yeast caused profile indistinguishable from
  VP

** Increase Plasma Porphyrin Concentration: Renal and other Disorders
- plasma porphyrin concentration increased due to \downarrow renal or
  hepatobiliary excretion is impaired
- ESRF marked increase in concentration, poor clearance by dialysis
  - similar to PCT, but not as high
  - PCT uncommon complicaiton of ESRF
  - distinguish with fecal porphyrin analysis
** Hematologic Disorders
- iron deficiency anemia, Zn acts as alternate substrate for FECH
  - results in \uparrow erythrocyte ZPP
  - also sideroblastic megaloblastic, and hemolytic anemias
** Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type I
- \uparrow succinylacetone resembles ALA, inhibits ALAD
  - \uparrow ALA accumulates in urine
