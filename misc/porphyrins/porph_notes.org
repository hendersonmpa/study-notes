* Porphyrin Chemistry
** Nomenclature
- porphyrinogen :: reduced form
- protoporphyrin :: containing iron \to heme
- ferriheme :: bound to Fe^{3+}
- hematin :: ferriheme with OH counter ion

** Spectra
- soret band :: maximal absorbance at ~ 400 nm \to emits at 550-600nm
** Solubility

* Biosynthesis
- *Site:* mitochondria \to cytoplasm \to mitochondria
- Starts with succinyl-CoA and glycine in mitochondria
- 70-80% in bone marrow
- 15% in other tissue ie. liver \to Cyto P450, cytochromes

** Enzymes
*** ALAS: 5-Aminolevulinate Synthase-ADP
- mitochondrial
- rate limiting step under normal conditions
*** ALAD: Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase-ALADP
- aka: porphobilinogen synthase
- requires zinc
- inhibited by lead
*** HMBS: Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase-AIP
- aka: PBG deaminase
- susceptible to allosteric inhibition by CIII and protoporphyrinogen
- HMB is unstable \to \uparrow URO I
*** UROS: Uroporphyrinogen III synthase-CEP
*** UROD: Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase-PCT
- last cytoplasmic enzyme
- hepta,hexa and pentacarboxylate intermediates all formed at the same
  active site
- \downarrow UROD \to increase in intermediates and URO
*** CPOX: Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase-HCP
- mitochondrial intermembrane space
- inhibited by metals
- specific for CIII
*** PPOX: Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase-VP
- inner mitochondrial membrane
*** FECH: Ferrochelatase-EPP
- inserts ferrous iron into protoporphyrin to form heme
- aka: heme synthase
- in iron deficient states forms Zn^{3+} \to zinc protoporphyrin

* Regulation of Biosynthesis
*** ALAS1- ubiquitous expression
- inhibited by heme
- induced by wide variety of drugs and chemicals that induce CYPS
*** ALAS2- erythroid form
- induced by erythroid differentiation

* Excretion
- Carboxyl groups make the porphyrin more soluble in water. Porphyrins
  with less than 4 carboxyl groups are not found in appreciable
  amounts in urine. The less soluble porphyrins with 2-3 carboxyl
  groups are excreted mostly in bile and feces. Coproporphyrin is
  excreted by both routes.

  - porphyrin catalysed photodamage
- Acute neuroviseral attacks
    1) abdominal pain
    2) peripheral neuropathy
    3) mental disturbance
- Acute attacks
  - linked to increased formation of ALA
  - induced activity of hepatic ALAS1
  - \downarrow hepatic heme bc of \uparrow hepatic CYPS
    - drugs

- *ADP, AIP, VP, HCP*
- Low clinical penetrance is a promenent feature of all AD acute porphyrias
- 25% of patients with overt acute porphyria have no family history
  + sporadic presentation reflects high prevalence and low penetrance
  + acute porphyria caused by de novo mutation is uncommon
- Allelic heterogenetity
*** Clinical Features
- Life threatening neuroviseral attack occur in AIP,VP and HCP
  are clinically identical

- persistent psychiatric illness is not a feature of acute porphyrias.
  - disappears with remission
**** Precipitating factors
1) drugs
2) alcohol, especially binge drinking
3) the menstrual cycle
4) calorie restriction
5) infection
6) stress
**** Drugs
- barbiturates, sulfonamides, progestogens, anticonvulsants
- http://www.drugs-porphyria.org
**** Long term complications
- chronic renal failure
- hypertension
- primary hepatocellular carcinoma

** Non-acute Porphyrias (Table \ref{tbl:onset})
- *PCT, CEP, EPP*
*** PCT
- *UROD*
- most common, 2-5/million in UK
- both sexes
- onset during 5th and sixth decade
**** Clincal features
- lesions on sun-exposed skin
  - back of hands
  - forearm
  - face
- fragile skin
- subepidermal bullae, milia, hypertrichosis of the face, patchy pigmentation
- \uparrow LFTs in 50%
- Skin lesions with liver damage associated with:
  - alcohol abuse
  - estrogens
  - infection with heptotropic viruses, HCV
  - hemochromatosis, iron overload
**** Pathogenesis and Molecular Genetics
- \downarrow activity of UROD in liver \to \uparrow URO
- 50% \downarrow in UROD activity does not \to overt PCT
  - further inactivation in the liver is required
- 80% of patients have sporadic (type I)
  - enzyme defect is restricted to the liver
  - typically no family history
- Famillial (type II)
  - mutation in one UROD gene \to 1/2 normal activity
- Exposure to polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons
**** Treatment
- \downarrow exposure to light
- iron depletion
- chloroquine
*** CEP
- *UROS*
- least common, most severe of the cutaneous porphyrias.
  - < 1:million in UK
**** Clinical Features
- Varying severity
  - hydrops fetalis
  - onset in infancy of severe skin lesions, transfusion dependent
    hemolytic anemia
  - mid-life onset of mild skin lesions resembling PCT
- Most present in early infancy
  - blisters on skin after UV exposure
  - reb-brown staining of diapers by urinary porphyrins
- Ongoing destruction of ears, nose and eyelids, alopecia
- red brown teeth
- Skin changes usually accompanied by hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly
**** Pathogenesis and Molecular Genetics
- Autosomal recessive, mutations in UROS or rarely GATA1
- \downarrow UROS \to \uparrow UI
- usually heteroallelic
**** Treatment
- \downarrow UV exposure
- curative treatment - allogenic bone marrow transplantation
- investigating gene therapy

*** EPP
- *FECH*
- X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP)
  - 2% of EPP cases
  - due to gain of function *ALAS2* mutation
- life long acute photosensitivity due to \uparrow protoporphyrin-IX
  in the skin
- Absence of fragile skin, subepidermal bullae, and hypertrichosis
  distinguishes it from all other cutaneous porphyrias.

**** Clinical Features
- acute photosensitivity
- onset birth \to age 6, median = 1 year
- both sexes
- onset after 40 very rare
  - most cases associated with myelodysplasia, caused by aquired
    somatic mutation of FECH.
- Most severe complication is progressive hepatic failure
- Cholelithiasis - gallstones promoted by \uparrow protoporphyri in bile
- mild microcytic anemia

**** Molecular Pathology and Genetics
- \uparrow protoporphyrin mainly in bone marrow
- FECH mutation is autosomal recessive
- compound heterozygotes
- Threshold FECH activity = 35% \to \uparrow protoporphyrin.
- see XLDPP above
**** Treatment
- avoid sunlight
- annual LFTs
- orthotopic liver transplantation
- bone marrow transplantation

** Abnormalities of Porphyrin Metabolism not caused by Porphyria
- More common cause of abnormal porphyrin metabolism than porphyria.
*** Lead and Other Heavy Metals
- Lead exposure \uparrow urinary ALA and coproporphyrin III excretion
  and accumulation of ZN-protoporphyrin in erythrocytes
  - inhibition of ALAD, CPOX
  - Pb causes mito deficiency in Fe \to Zn replaces Fe as
    substrate for FECH
  - \uparrow ALA excretion secondary to inhibition of ALAD
    - caused by lead displacing zinc at catalytic site
    - ALAD2 isoform more susceptible than ALAD1
*** Secondary Coproporphyrinuria: Hepatobiliary and other Disorders
- Most common cause of abnormal porphyrin excretion
  - alcohol intake :: CIII
  - impaired biliary excretion of CI :: \to urine
    - cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and cirrhosis
    - reversal of normal ratio: CI dominates
    - drugs
    - severe infection
  - Dubin-Johnson :: \uparrow CI, \downarrow CII
  - Rotor :: \uparrow CI, normal CIII
  - Gilbert :: \uparrow CI, \uparrow CIII

*** Increased Fecal Porphyrin Concentration
- Protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins derived from
  bacterial metabolism.
- Additional protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins formed
  from heme containing proteins from diet or gastrointestinal
  hemorrhage.
- Even minor hemorrhage (ie FOBT negative) \uparrow dicarboxylic porphyrins.
- Confusion with EPP may occur when associated iron deficiency
  \uparrow erythrocyte total porphyrin, and skin lesions for other reasons.
- Confusion with VP when coexisting liver disease causes
  Coproporphyrinuria.
- Porphyria is excluded when no porphyrin fluorescence is detectable
  on fluorescenceq emission spectroscopy of plasma and fecal
  coproporphyrin excretion is normal.
- Consumption of Brewers yeast caused profile indistinguishable from
  VP.

*** Increase Plasma Porphyrin Concentration: Renal and other Disorders
- Plasma Porphyrin concentration increased due to \downarrow renal or
  hepatobiliary excretion is impaired.
- ESRF marked increase in concentration, poor clearance by dialysis
  - Similar to PCT, but not as high
  - PCT uncommon complicaiton of ESRF
  - Distinguish with fecal porphyrin analysis
*** Hematologic Disorders
- iron deficiency anemia, Zn acts as alternate substrate for FECH
  - results in \uparrow erythrocyte ZPP
  - also sideroblastic megaloblastic, and hemolytic anemias
*** Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type I
- \uparrow succinylacetone resembles ALA, inhibits ALAD
  - \uparrow ALA accumulates in urine.

- Acute attacks always associated with \uparrow excretion of ALA and PBG
  - except ADP where only ALA is increased
- DNA and enzyme analyses give no information about disease activity
  and are rarely necessary to confirm the diagnosis in clincally overt porphyria.
  - mainly used for family studies in AD acute porphyrias and EPP.
** Patients with Symptoms of Porphyria
- Depends on mode of presentation
*** Patients with Current or Past Symptoms Consistent with an Acute Neuroviseral Attack
1) investigating the acute attack
2) diagnosing the cause of the attack
3) investigating possible acute porphyria when patient is in remission
**** Investigation During a Suspected Acute Attack
- urinary PBG is always increased during acute attack of AIP, HCP or VP
  - 5-10x upper reference limit
- Measurement of urinary total porphyrins should not be used to screen
  for acute porphyria
  - false positive due to secondary coproporphyrinuria are common
**** Diffentiation between Acute Porphyrias
- Urinary Porphyrins :: *unhelpful for differentiation of acute
     porphyrias*
- Enzyme assays :: not useful in acute porphyrias
  - HMBS/PBG deaminase activity not sensitive enough to detect AIP
    - overlaps with normal
  - CPOX and PPOX assays are difficult and not essential
- VP :: plasma fluorescence emission peak around 626 nm confirms
- AIP and HCP :: plasma fluorescence normal or peak at 620 nm
  - distinguish via fecal
  - AIP fecal = normal
  - HCP fecal = increased
**** Investigation of an Asymtomatic Patient with Past Symptoms Consistent with and Acute Attack
- Quantitative PBG and ALA
- Plasma fluorescence scan in VP
- Fecal CI/CIII HCP
- CPOX and PPOX genetics only if clinical suspicion remains very high
- If above normal ADP excluded, VP and HCP very low \to AIP in
  remission or non-porphyria
  - HMBS activity and mutation analysis may help
*** Patients with Cutaneous Symptoms
- Skin lesions of cutaneous porphyrias are always accompanied by
  overproduction of porphyrins.
**** Patients with Acute Photosensitivity without Skin Fragility or Bullae
- often children with EPP or other non-porphyria
- EPP :: erythrocyte porphyrin concentration, microscopy unreliable
  - if within RI EPP is excluded
  - if increased \to FEP or ZPP
  - fecal porphyrins not essential
  - FECH genetics useful to assess risk of liver disease
  - If EPP confirmed investigate for protoporphyric liver disease ie
    LFTs
**** Patients with Bullae/Fragility/Scarring
- Clinically indistinguishable lesions occur in PCT, VP, HCP, and CEP
  - also rare variants HEP
  - pseudo-porphyrias \to drugs, and sunbeds
- Total urinary porphyrins and fluorescence emission
  spectroscopy of plasma
- Most patients will have PCT or VP
  - plasma emmision peak around 626 nm \to VP
    - no further investigation necessary
  - plasma emmision peak around 618 to 620 nm \to PCT
    - not specific
    - fractionate urinary or fecal porphyrins
- CEP requires fraction of urinary and fecal porphyrins and FEP.
- Normal plasma fluorescence scan excludes porphyria as the cause of
  active skin lesions.
- PCT excretion and plasma porphyrin concentrations return to normal
- In patients with healed lesions and normal porphyrin quantitation,
  abnormal porphyrin proportions remain abnormal longer
- Plasma fluorescence scan in VP and fecal CIII in HCP remain abnormal
  during remission.
- Patients with PCT should be screened for HFE mutations.
**** Asymtomatic Relatives of Patients with Porphyria
- Screen of autosomal dominant acute porphyrias is essential
  - AIP, VP, HCP
  - metabolites, enzyme assay, DNA or combination
  - Erythrocyte HMBS activity widely used in screening
  - DNA is the method of choice for family studies
- EPP
  - mutations in FECH
- Other porphyrias
  - autosomal recessive disorder \to limited role for family studies
    - CEP, ADP
* Analytical Methods
** Methods for Metabolites
1) ALA
2) PBG
3) Urinary Porphyrins
4) Fecal Porphyrins
5) Blood Porphyrins
*** Specimen Collection and Stability
- Protect from light
- Urinary porphyrins and PBG best collected in fresh random urine
  without preservative. Very dilute urine (creatinine <2 mmol/L) is
  not suitable
- 24 hour urine offer little advantage
  1) delay diagnosis
  2) increased risk of degradation
*** EQA
- EPNET http://www.porphyria-europe.com
  - open to lab throughout the world
*** Methods for Porphyrin Precursors
**** Porphobilinogen
- Ehrlich's reagent
  - urobilinogen inhibition, therefore ion-exchange
**** 5-Aminolevulinic Acid
- Converted to Ehrlich's reacting pyrrole via condensation with
  acetylacetone
**** Analysis of Porphyrins in Urine and Feces
- Screening via spectrophotometric scanning of acidified urine or
  fecal extracts for the Soret band
**** Semiquantitative Method for Total Porphyrin in Urine and Feces
- we do this as a screen
**** HPLC Fractionation of Porphyrins in Urine and Feces
- fluormetric detection recommended
*** Methods for Blood Porphyrins
**** Determination of Erythrocyte Total Porphyrin
- increased in:
  - EPP
  - CEP
  - homozygous variants
  - iron deficiency
  - hemolytic anemia
  - some other forms of anemia
  - lead poisoning
- total porphyrin concentration within RI excludes EPP
    - distinction between EPP and other causes requires diffentiation
      between protoporphyrin and ZN-protoporphyrin
**** Qualitative Determination of ZN-protoporphyrin and Protoporphyrin
- Emission peaks for ZPP = 587 nm and free protoporphyrin = 630 nm
- In EPP the concentration of free protoporphyrin >> ZPP
  - may be 60% of total porphyrin
- Lead poisoning, iron deficiency and other anemias ZPP is the main
  component.
- Limitation of method is that extraction of ZPP is ~50%

*** Analysis of Plasma Porphyrins
**** Fluorescence emision Spectroscopy of Plasma Porphyrins
- Emission spectra of saline diluted plasma excited at 405 nm
- In VP the plasma contains porphyrin covalently bound to protein with
  E_max at 624 to 628 nm
- Other porphyrias contain porphyrin non-covalently bound to albumin
  and hemopexin.
  - Fresh plasma protoporphyrin E_max = 632 nm
  - Older sample: binding to globulin released from red cells E_max =
    626 nm
- 2\degree causes of increase include: impaired excretion, renal
  failure, cholestasis
*** Enzyme Measurements
- rarely required for patients with symptoms
- can be used for family studies, DNA is better
**** Assay of Etythrocyte Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase Activity
- Measures rate of formation of porphyrinogens from PBG by hemolysed erythrocytes
- Discriminates between AIP and unaffected relatives
- Interferences:
  - HMBS activity declines sharply with erythrocyte age
  - affected by \prop of retics, and young cells in peripheral blood
  - \uparrow in acute illness, ie acute porphyria
  - \sim 1:800 low HMBS activity in France
*** DNA analysis
- required for
  1) family screening
  2) pattern of inheritance in EPP
  3) prognosis in CEP

- can be used in patients without current symptoms or biochemical
  Abnormalities
- sequencing and gene dosage Analysis
