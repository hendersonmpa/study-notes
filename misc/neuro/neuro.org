* Introduction
- classical neurotransmitter systems involve:
  - inhibitory
    - aminoacidergic :: \gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine
  - excitatory
    - aminoacidergic :: aspartate and glutamate
    - cholinergic :: acetylcholine
    - monoaminergic :: adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin
    - purinergic :: adenosine and adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate

- Addition of
  - neuro-peptides the largest family of signalling molecules in the nervous system)
  - channels that modulate neurotransmitter actions
  - new approaches based on synaptic physiology will likely reclassify
    neurotransmitter systems and disorders in the future.

- GABA is formed from glutamic acid by glutamic acid decarboxylase
- catabolized into succinic acid through the sequential action of two
  mitochondrial enzymes:
  - GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
- Glutamic acid decarboxylase and GABA transaminase require pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme
- Pyridoxal phosphate also participates in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin
  - and many other pathways including the glycine cleavage system
- GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter present in high concentration in the CNS
  - predominantly in the gray matter
- GABA modulates brain activity by binding to
  sodium-independent,high-affinity, mostly GABA A receptors
- Glycine is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS
- The inhibitory glycine receptors are mostly found in the brain stem
  and spinal cord
- Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain
- Its function requires rapid uptake to replenish intracellular
  neuronal pools following extracellular release

- Inborn errors of neurotransmission include neurotransmitter
  metabolism, receptor and transporter defects:
  - Three defects of GABA catabolism have been reported (section [[GABA]])
  - Three receptor defects (section [[Inborn Errors of Receptors and Transporter of Neurotransmitters]])
  - Three transportopathies are reported section [[Inborn Errors of Receptors and Transporter of Neurotransmitters]])
  - Six disorders of monoamine metabolism (section [[Inborn Errors of Monoamine Metabolism]])
  - See aminoacidopathies for disorders of glycine metabolism
* GABA Catabolism
- Three defects of GABA catabolism have been reported:
  1) GABA transaminase deficiency (very rare, severe, and untreatable)
  2) succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency
  3) homocarnosinosis

** Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD) was first
  reported as \gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria (4-hydroxybutyric aciduria)
- the most prevalent of the disorders of GABA metabolism

*** Clinical Presentation
- non specific clinical manifestations including:
  - developmental delay and early-onset hypotonia
  - later-onset expressive language impairment
  - obsessive–compulsive disorder
  - hyporeflexia, non-progressive ataxia, and epilepsy

*** Metabolic Derangement
- key feature is an accumulation of \gamma-hydroxybutyrate in urine,
  plasma, and CSF
- \gamma-hydroxybutyrate and GABA (\uparrow 3x in CSF) are
  neuropharmacologically active compounds
- additional biochemical abnormalities relate to GABA, succinic semialdehyde, and GHB
  - \uparrow homocarnosine in CSF
  - \uparrow guanidinobutyrate in CSF
  - \uparrow D-2-hydroxyglutarate
  - \uparrow succinic semialdehyde
  - \uparrow 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid
- Many of these intermediates likely derive from succinic semialdehyde
- \downarrow glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant

*** Genetics
- AR, ALDH5A1

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow \gamma-hydroxybutyric acid in urine
- followed by molecular diagnosis via sequencing of ALDH5A1
- Concomitant identification of 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid , both the
  free and lactone form (threo-, erythro-) in the organic acid profile
  is highly suggestive
- GHB is also employed clinically (Xyrem R (sodium saltof GHB); for
  cataplexy) and illicitly (for induction of euphoria)

*** Treatment and Prognosis
- Sudden death can occur in patients often in association with
  epilepsy (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy or SUDEP)
- therapeutic intervention has historically employed vigabatrin
  (Sabril R ; gamma-vinyl GABA)
  - an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase
- beneficial in some but without efficacy in others
- remains to be determined whether enhancing GABA levels in SSADHD
  (which are already elevated) is prudent, and the visual field
  disturbances associated with vigabatrin are treatment limiting

* Inborn Errors of Receptors and Transporters of Neurotransmitters
- receptors defects:
  - hyperekplexia is usually due to a dominantly inherited defect of the
    \alpha 1 subunit of the glycine receptor which causes excessive
    startle responses, and is treatable with clonazepam
  - mutations in GABA A receptor are a cause of dominantly inherited
    epilepsy
  - mutations in glutamate receptors associate with neurodevelopmental
    and psychiatric disorders
- three transportopathies are reported:
  - mitochondrial glutamate transporter defect
    - a cause of severe epileptic encephalopathy
  - diseases that produce early parkinsonism-dystonia:
    - dopamine transporter defect
    - vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 defect
* Inborn Errors of Monoamine Metabolism
- The monoamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin,
  are metabolites of the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan
- The first step in their formation is catalysed by
  amino-acid-specific hydroxylases, which require tetrahydrobiopterin (BH_4) as a cofactor
- BH_4 is also a cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase
- Its synthesis from GTP is initiated by the rate-limiting GTP
  cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH-I), which forms dihydroneopterin
  triphosphate (NH2TP)
- L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are meabolized by a common
  B6-dependent aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) into
  dopamine (the precursor of the catecholamines, adrenaline and
  noradrenaline) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), respectively
- Adrenaline and noradrenaline are catabolized into vanillylmandelic
  acid (VMA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) via
  monoamino oxidase A (MAO-A)
- MOA-A is also involved in the catabolism of both dopamine into
  homovanillic acid (HVA) via 3-methoxytyramine, and of serotonin into
  5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
- Dopaminergic modulation of ion fluxes regulates emotion, activity,
  behaviour, nerve conduction, and the release of a number of hormones
  via G-protein-coupled cell-surface dopamine
  receptors.
- Serotoninergic neurotransmission modulates body temperature, blood
  pressure, endocrine secretion, appetite, sexual behaviour, movement,
  emesis, and pain.

- Six disorders of monoamine metabolism:
  - Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency
    - impairs synthesis of dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) and causes
      a neurological disease with prominent extrapyramidal signs, and
      a variable response to L-dopa.
    - \uparrow HVA, MHPG, and 5-HIAA in the CSF
    - The HVA/5HIAA ratio in CSF is the most sensitive marker not only
      for diagnosis but also to identify the severity of the phenotype
  - dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency
    - severe orthostatic hypotension with sympathetic failure
    - \Downarrow plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline
    - \uparrow plasma dopamine
  - other disorders of monoamine metabolism involve both catecholamine
    and serotonin metabolism.
  - Aromatic-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)
    - located upstream of the neurotransmitter amines
    - treatment can be challenging
    - \downarrow HVA and 5-HIAA in CSF
    - \uparrow 3-O-methyl-l-dopa and 5-HTP w normal pterin concentrations
    - \uparrow VLA in urinary organic acid 
  - Monoamine-oxidase A (MAO-A) deficiency
    - located downstream, mainly causes behavioral disturbances
    - no effective treatment is known
    - \uparrow random urine serotonin, normetanephrine, metanephrine, and 3-MT
    - abnormal normetanephrine:VMA, normetanephrine:MHPG, HVA:VMA ratios
  - guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-I (GTPCH-I) and
    sepiapterin reductase (SR) deficiencies
    - pterin disorders upstream of L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan
      (5-HTP) with normal baseline phenylalaninemia and effective
      treatment (especially GTPCH-I deficiency)
    - GTPCH-I labs
      - normal or \downarrow CSF HVA with
      - \downarrow CSF 5-HIAA
    - SR labs
      - \uparrow CSF biopterin and sepiapterin in CSF
      - normal CSF neopterin
      - \Downarrow CSF HVA and 5-HIAA
