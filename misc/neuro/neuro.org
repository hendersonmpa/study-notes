* Introduction
- classical neurotransmitter systems involve:
  - inhibitory
    - aminoacidergic :: \gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine
  - excitatory
    - aminoacidergic :: aspartate and glutamate
    - cholinergic :: acetylcholine
    - monoaminergic :: adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin
    - purinergic :: adenosine and adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate

- GABA is formed from glutamic acid by glutamic acid decarboxylase
  (Figure [[fig:gaba]])
- catabolized into succinic acid through the sequential action of two
  mitochondrial enzymes:
  - GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
- glutamic acid decarboxylase and GABA transaminase require PLP as a coenzyme
  - PLP also participates in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin
  - many other pathways including the glycine cleavage system
- GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter present in high
  concentration in the CNS
  - predominantly in the gray matter
- GABA modulates brain activity by binding to
  sodium-independent,high-affinity, mostly GABA A receptors
- glycine is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS
- inhibitory glycine receptors are mostly found in the brain stem
  and spinal cord
- glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain
  - requires rapid uptake to replenish intracellular
    neuronal pools following extracellular release
- inborn errors of neurotransmission include neurotransmitter
  metabolism, receptor and transporter defects:
  - three defects of GABA catabolism have been reported (section [[GABA catabolism]])
  - three receptor defects (section [[Receptors and Transporters of Neurotransmitters]])
  - three transportopathies are reported (section [[Receptors and Transporters of Neurotransmitters]])
  - six disorders of monoamine metabolism (section [[Monoamine Metabolism]])
  - see amino acids for disorders of glycine metabolism
* GABA catabolism
- three defects of \gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) catabolism have been reported:
  1) GABA transaminase deficiency (very rare, severe, and untreatable)
  2) succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency
  3) homocarnosinosis

** Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- first reported as \gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria (4-hydroxybutyric
  aciduria)
- most prevalent of the disorders of GABA metabolism

*** Clinical Presentation
- non-specific clinical manifestations including:
  - developmental delay and early-onset hypotonia
  - later-onset expressive language impairment
  - obsessive-compulsive disorder
  - hyporeflexia, non-progressive ataxia, and epilepsy

*** Metabolic Derangement
- key feature is an accumulation of \gamma-hydroxybutyrate in urine,
  plasma, and CSF
- \gamma-hydroxybutyrate and GABA (\uparrow 3x in CSF) are
  neuropharmacologically active compounds
- additional biochemical abnormalities relate to GABA, succinic semialdehyde, and GHB
  - \uparrow CSF homocarnosine
  - \uparrow CSF guanidinobutyrate
  - \uparrow urine D-2-hydroxyglutarate
  - \uparrow urine succinic semialdehyde
  - \uparrow urine 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid
- many of these intermediates likely derive from succinic semialdehyde
- \downarrow glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant

*** Genetics
- AR, ALDH5A1

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow urine \gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)
- \uparrow urine 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid
  - both the free and lactone form (threo-, erythro-) in the organic acid profile
    is highly suggestive
- molecular diagnosis via sequencing of ALDH5A1
- GHB is also employed clinically (Xyrem R (sodium saltof GHB); for
  cataplexy) and illicitly (for induction of euphoria)

*** Treatment and Prognosis
- sudden death can occur in patients often in association with
  epilepsy (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy or SUDEP)
- therapeutic intervention has historically employed vigabatrin
  - an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase
- beneficial in some
- remains to be determined whether enhancing GABA levels in SSADHD
  (which are already elevated) is prudent

* Receptors and Transporters of Neurotransmitters
- receptors defects:
  - dominantly inherited defect of the \alpha1-subunit of the glycine
    receptor causes  causes hyperekplexia (excessive startle responses)
    - treatable with clonazepam
  - mutations in GABA A receptor are a cause of dominantly inherited
    epilepsy
  - mutations in glutamate receptors associate with neurodevelopmental
    and psychiatric disorders
- three transportopathies are reported:
  - mitochondrial glutamate transporter defect
    - a cause of severe epileptic encephalopathy
  - diseases that produce early parkinsonism-dystonia:
    - dopamine transporter defect
    - vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 defect
* Monoamine Metabolism
- the monoamines: adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin
  are metabolites of the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan
- first step in formation is catalysed by amino-acid-specific
  hydroxylases which require tetrahydrobiopterin (BH_4) as a cofactor
  (Figure [[fig:monoamines]])
- synthesis of BH_4 from GTP is initiated by the rate-limiting GTP
  cyclohydrolase (GTPCH)
  - forms dihydroneopterin triphosphate
- BH_4 is also a cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase
- B_6-dependent aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) converts:
  - L-dopa \to dopamine, the precursor of the catecholamines,
    adrenaline and noradrenaline
  - 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to serotonin (AKA 5-hydroxytryptamine)
- adrenaline and noradrenaline are catabolized into vanillylmandelic
  acid (VMA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) via
  monoamino oxidase A (MAO-A)
- MOA-A is also involved in the catabolism of
  - dopamine into homovanillic acid (HVA) via 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT)
  - serotonin into 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
- dopaminergic modulation of ion fluxes regulates emotion, activity,
  behaviour, nerve conduction, and the release of a number of hormones
  via G-protein-coupled cell-surface dopamine
  receptors
- serotoninergic neurotransmission modulates body temperature, blood
  pressure, endocrine secretion, appetite, sexual behaviour, movement,
  emesis, and pain
