* Copper 
- copper is essential for cellular metabolism and toxic at [\Uparrow]
  - superoxide dismutase holoenzyme
- \gt 90% of circulating copper is bound to ceruloplasmin
- absorbed each day from the intestine
- removed from portal circulation by hepatocytes
- excretion of copper by liver into bile is only method of removal
- copper transporter CTR1 responsible for copper uptake in enterocytes and hepatocytes
- intracellular transport done by two related ATPases
  - Menkes :: absorption : enterocytes : ATP7A 
  - Wilson :: excretion : hepatocytes : ATP7B

** Wilson Disease
*** Clinical Presentation
- hepatic symptoms 8-20 years
- neurological symptoms 2nd-3rd decade
- suspect in patients with:
  - liver disease w no obvious cause
  - movement disorder
- occasionally isolated:
  - \uparrow transaminases
  - Kayser-Fleischer rings
  - hemolysis
- diagnosis often made in siblings of patient

*** Metabolic Derangement
- ATP7B has 6 copper binding domains
- expressed predominantly in liver and kidney
- defect in trans-Golgi protein ATP7B
  - required for excretion of copper and incorporation into ceruloplasmin 
- \downarrow t_{1/2} of ceruloplasmin with out bound copper
- rare patients with excretion defect and normal ceruloplasmin binding
- \downarrow excretion of copper into bile
- accumulation of copper in liver
  - secondary accumulation in brain, kidney and eyes

*** Genetics
- AR, ATP7B
- 1:30,000 may be higher
- \sim 1/90 carriers

*** Diagnostic tests
- \downarrow serum ceruloplasmin
- \downarrow serum copper
- \uparrow urine copper
- \uparrow liver copper
- \uparrow free copper
  - 1 mg ceruloplasmin contains 3.4 ug copper
- results should be taken together, there is a scoring system [fn:cpg]
- genetic analysis in family
- possible candidate for NBS

[fn:cpg] Clinical Practice Guidelines: Wilson's Disease, J Hepatol 56:671-685

*** Treatment
- excellent prognosis if treated before severe damage
- penicillamine chelates copper and is excreted in urine
- oral zinc induces metallothionein synthesis
  - metallothionein binds copper preferentially to zinc
  - fecal excretion
- trien (triethylenetetramine) is a chelator
  - used when penicillamine is not tolerated
- combination therapy should be staggered - don't chelate treatment

** Menkes Disease
*** Clinical Presentation
 - male infants 2-3 months
 - neurodegeneration manifests as:
   - seizures, hypotonia, loss of milestones
 - non-specific signs at birth:
   - prematurity, large cephalhaematomas, skin laxity, hypothermia
   - hair breaks easily, sandpaper feel

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - defect in ATP7A 
 - normal copper uptake, can not be exported from enterocytes into circulation
 - insufficient copper for incorporation into ~20 cuproenzymes including:
   - lysloxidase :: collagen cross-linking
   - tyrosinase :: melanin formation
   - dopamine \beta-hydroxylase :: catacholamine biosynthesis
   - peptidyl glycine monooxygenase :: neuropeptide precursors
   - cytochrome c-oxidase :: ETC

*** Genetics 
 - ATB7A, *XLR*, 1:250,000 , 1/3 /de novo/ mutations
 - expressed in all tissues except liver

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - \downarrow serum copper 
 - \downarrow serum ceruloplasmin 
   - not specific in 0-3 months of life
 - \uparrow plasma dopamine/norepinephrine
 - \uparrow copper retention in cultured fibroblasts

*** Treatment
 - often fatal < 3 years
   - infection or vascular complications
 - parenteral treatment should bypass ATP7A
   - disappointing results
   - near normal intellectual and motor development only possible with
     residual ATP7A activity

* Iron
- iron is essential for the synthesis of haem and other
  metalloproteins
  - iron sulfur protein cluster is very important has acrucial role in
    mitochondrial metabolism
- \gt 20 mg of iron per day is required, only 1â€“2 mg from intestinal absorption,
  - the remainder is re-used
- not actively secreted from the body
- \uparrow [iron] \to \uparrow [circulating free iron]
  - primarily taken up by the liver, the pancreas and the heart
  - syndromes manifest with cirrhosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy
- absorption of iron occurs primarily in the duodenum via the
  divalent-metal transporter(DMT1)
- major recycling route for iron is removal from erythrocytic heme by
  hemeoxygenase
  - in macrophages and enterocytes
- circulating free iron binds to to apo-transferrin forming holo-transferrin
- transferrin can only bind iron in the ferric state 
- ceruloplasmin catalyses the oxidization of Fe^{2+} into Fe^{3+}
- transferrin receptor mediates the uptake of transferrin
- iron is released from intracellular transferrin by a specific isoform of DMT1
- iron can be stored bound to ferritin until needed in several cell
  types, including macrophages

** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis
*** Clinical Presentation
 - also called Type 1 or HFE related haemochromatosis
 - slow but progressive accumulation of iron in various organs
 - clinically apparent by the fourth or fifth decade of life
 - initial symptoms are nonspecific and include:
   - fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss and arthralgia
 - increased awareness, and improved diagnostic testing
   - classic symptoms of full-blown haemochromatosis are rarely seen
     - liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiomyopathy,
       hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, arthropathy and skin
       pigmentation

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - caused by a disturbance in iron homeostasis associated with hepcidin
   deficiency and systemic accumulation of iron
 - exact role of HFE is unclear
   - sensing iron levels and thus indirectly for regulating hepcidin
     synthesis

*** Genetics
 - AR, HFE
 - ~ 0.5% of the Northern European population are homozygous for the
   C282Y mutation in HFE
   - only 5% of male and <1% of female C282Y homozygotes eventually
     develop liver fibrosis or cirrhosis

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - \Uparrow transferrin saturation initially 
 - followed by \Uparrow serum ferritin
   - reflects increasing iron overload
 - genetic testing of HFE should be performed when:
   - transferrin saturation is above 45%
   - serum ferritin is elevated:
     - >200 ng/ml in adult females
     - >300 ng/ml in adult males

***  Treatment and Prognosis
 - \gt half male and female C282Y homozygotes have normal serum
   ferritin levels and may never require therapy
 - many have moderately elevated serum ferritin levels
   - unclear whether all should have regular
     phlebotomies to reduce systemic iron load
 - serum ferritin levels exceeding 1000 ng/ml a phlebotomy regimen is clearly
   necessary.
   - in adults initially 500 ml blood is removed weekly or bi-weekly
   - phlebotomy frequency is usually reduced to once every 3-6 months
     when serum ferritin levels are \lt 50 ng/ml

** Systemic Iron Overload Syndromes
*** Juvenile Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 2)
 - most severe type of hereditary haemochromatosis
   - probably because hepcidin deficiency is more pronounced
 - patients present in the 2nd and 3rd decade
   - mostly w hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and cardiomyopathy due to
     iron overload
 - type 2A is caused by mutations in the HJV gene encoding for hemojuvelin
   - necessary for proper hepcidin synthesis
 - type 2B from mutations in the HAMP gene encoding hepcidin
 - \uparrow serum ferritin and transferrin saturation as in
   classic HFE-related haemochromatosis
 - diagnosis is made by mutation analysis
 - phlebotomy is the treatment of choice and may prevent organ damage
   if initiated early

*** TFR2-Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 3)
 - transferrin receptor 2 is important for sensing the intracellular
   iron status (e.g erythroid cells)
 - iron overload phenotype which resembles classic HFE-related
   haemochromatosis
   - patients are generally younger
 - \downarrow hepcidin
 - \uparrow transferrin saturation
 - \uparrow ferritin
 - \uparrow liver iron content
 - diagnosis made by mutation analysis
 - phlebotomy is the treatment of choice

*** Ferroportin Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 4)
 - differs in several ways from the other three subtypes of haemochromatosis
 - AD inheritance and caused by mutations in SLC40A1 encoding ferroportin
 - expressed at the enterocyte and plasma membrane of macrophages
 - loss of function mutations impair the export of iron from macrophages causing an iron
   deficiency in erythrocytic precursors
 - patients present with a combination of mild microcytic anaemia with
   low transferrin saturation
   - iron overload predominantly in macrophages
   - tolerance to phlebotomy is limited by the concurrent anaemia
 - gain of function mutations cause resistance to feedback inhibition
   by hepcidin
   - these patients present with a more classic hepatic iron overload
     haemochromatosis phenotype

*** Neonatal Haemochromatosis
 - once thought to be an AR inherited disorder now recognized as
   acquired
   - any disease state that chronically prevents the synthesis or
     activity of hepcidin will lead to haemochromatosis.
 - patients present in the first few weeks of life with severe liver
   failure
 - caused by a maternal allo-immune reaction to the infant liver
   - starts /in utero/
 - liver injury leads to a decrease in hepcidin
   - manifests as severe siderosis of both liver and extrahepatic organs
 - diagnosis is made in any child with neonatal liver failure in
   combination with high serum ferritin and extrahepatic siderosis
   - shown by MRI and/or oral mucosal biopsy
   - iron deposits in minor salivary glands in patients with NH
 - therapy is by exchange transfusion in combination with IVIGs to
   remove/bind maternally derived IgG
 - risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy from a mother who has
   given birth to an affected child is as high as 90%
   - recurrence risk reduced by IVIGs during pregnancy

** Iron Deficiency and Distribution Disorders
*** Iron-Refractory Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IRIDA)
 - this disease is caused by a deficiency of matriptase-2 encoded by TMPRSS6
 - normal cleavage of haemojuvelin is interrupted \to \uparrow hepcidin
 - presesents in youth
   - iron deficiency
   - \downarrow transferrin saturation (<10%)
   - microcytic anaemia 
 - oral iron supplementation is not effective
   - high hepcidin levels will prevent iron release from the
     enterocytes
   - requires intravenous iron therapy

*** Atransferrinaemia
 - rare
 - AR, TF
 - presents with moderate to severe hypochromic microcytic anaemia and
   growth retardation along with signs of haemochromatosis
 - \downarrow serum transferrin
 - \uparrow serum ferritin 
 - treated with plasma infusions to increase the transferrin pool
