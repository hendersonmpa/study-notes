* Copper 
- Copper is essential for cellular metabolism and toxic at [\Uparrow]
  - superoxide dismutase
  - > 90% of circulating copper is bound to ceruloplasmin
- 2 mg of copper absorbed each day from the intestine
- removed from portal circulation by hepatocytes
- excretion of copper by liver into bile is only method of removal
- Copper transporter CTR1 responsible for copper uptake in enterocytes and hepatocytes
- Intra-cellular transport done by two related ATPases
  - ATP7A : absorption : enterocytes : Menkes
  - ATP7B : excretion : hepatocytes : Wilson

** Wilson Disease
*** Clinical Presentation
- hepatic symptoms 8-20 years
- neurological symptoms 2nd-3rd decade
- Suspect in patients with:
  - liver disease w no obvious cause
  - movement disorder
- Occasionally isolated:
  - \uparrow transaminases
  - Kayser-Fleischer rings
  - hemolysis
- Diagnosis often made in siblings of patient

*** Metabolic Derangement
- Defect in trans-Golgi protein ATP7B
  - required for excretion of copper and incorporation into ceruloplasmin 
- \downarrow t_{1/2} of ceruloplasmin with out bound copper
- rare patients with excretion defect and normal ceruloplasmin binding
- \downarrow excretion of copper into bile
- accumulation of copper in liver
  - secondary accumulation in brain, kidney and eyes

*** Genetics
- AR, mutations in ATP7B, 1:30,000 may be higher, \sim 1/90 carriers
- ATP7b has 6 copper binding domains
- expressed predominantly in liver and kidney
- > 500 mutations in ATP7B described
  - most patients are compound heterozygotes
- loss of function mutations \to early hepatic presentation
- mutations with residual activity \to late neurological presentation

*** Diagnostic tests
- \downarrow serum ceruloplasmin
- \downarrow serum copper
- \uparrow urine copper
- \uparrow liver copper
- \uparrow free copper
  - 1 mg ceruloplasmin contains 3.4 ug copper
- results should be taken together, there is a scoring system [fn:cpg]
- genetic analysis in family

- possible candidate for NBS

[fn:cpg] Clinical Practice Guidelines: Wilson's Disease, J Hepatol 56:671-685

*** Treatment
- excellent prognosis if treated before severe damage
- penicillamine chelates copper and is excreted in urine
- oral zinc induces metallothionein synthesis
  - metallothionein binds copper preferentially to zinc
  - fecal excretion
- Trien (triethylenetetramine) is a chelator, used in patients who don't tolerate penicillamine
- combination therapy should be staggered - don't chelate treatment!


** Menkes Disease

*** Clinical Presentation
 - male infants 2-3 months
 - neurodegeneration manifests as:
   - seizures, hypotonia, loss of milestones
 - non-specific signs at birth:
   - prematurity, large cephalhaematomas, skin laxity, hypothermia
   - hair breaks easily, sandpaper feel

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - Defect in ATP7A 
 - normal copper uptake, can not be exported from enterocytes into circulation
 - insufficient copper for incorporation into ~20 cuproenzymes
   - lysloxidase : collagen cross-linking
   - tyrosinase : melanin formation
   - dopamine \beta-hydroxylase : catacholamin biosynthesis
   - peptidyl glycine monooxygenase : neuropeptide precursors
   - cytochrome c-oxidase : ETC

*** Genetics 
 - ATB7A, XR, 1:250,000 , 1/3 /de novo/ mutations
 - expressed in all tissues except liver

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - \downarrow serum copper (< 11 umol/L)
 - \downarrow serum ceruloplasmin (< 200 mg/L)
 - not specific in 0-3 months of life
 - plasma dopamine/norepinephrine
 - copper retention in cultured fibroblasts

*** Treatment
 - often fatal < 3 years
   - infection or vascular complications
 - Parenteral treatment should bypass ATP7A
   - disappointing results
   - near normal intellectual and motor development only possible with
     residual ATP7A activity

* Iron
- Iron is essential for the synthesis of haem and other
  metalloproteins.
- Among these metalloproteins, the iron sulfur protein cluster is very important
  - crucial role in mitochondrial metabolism
- \gt 20 mg of iron per day is required, only 1â€“2 mg from intestinal absorption,
  - the remainder is re-used
- Not actively secreted from the body
- \uparrow [iron] \to \uparrow [circulating free iron]
  - primarily taken up by the liver, the pancreas and the heart.
  - syndromes manifest with cirrhosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy.
- Absorption of iron occurs primarily in the duodenum via the
  divalent-metal transporter(DMT1)
- The major recycling route for iron is removal from
  erythrocytic haem by haemoxygenase
  - in macrophages and enterocytes.
- Circulating free iron binds to to apo-transferrin forming holo-transferrin
- Transferrin can only bind iron in the ferric state 
- Ceruloplasmin catalyses the oxidization of Fe^{2+} into Fe^{3+}
- The transferrin receptor mediates the uptake of transferrin
- Iron is released from intracellular transferrin by a specific isoform of DMT1.
- In several cell types, including macrophages, iron can be stored
  bound to ferritin until needed.

** Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis
*** Clinical Presentation
 - Also called Type 1 or HFE related haemochromatosis
 - An autosomal recessive disorder
 - Slow but progressive accumulation of iron in various organs
 - Clinically apparent by the fourth or fifth decade of life
 - Initial symptoms are nonspecific and include:
   - fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss and arthralgia.
 - Increased awareness, and improved diagnostic testing
   - Classic symptoms of full-blown haemochromatosis are rarely seen
     - liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiomyopathy,
       hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, arthropathy and skin
       pigmentation

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - Caused by a disturbance in iron homeostasis associated with hepcidin
   deficiency and systemic accumulation of iron.
 - The exact role of HFE, is unclear at present.
 - Most probably it is essential for sensing iron levels and thus
   indirectly for regulating hepcidin synthesis.

*** Genetics
 - As many as 0.5% of the Northern European population are homozygous
   for the C282Y mutation in HFE,

   - only 5% of male and <1% of female C282Y homozygotes eventually
     develop liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

 - Other mutations in HFE are also described, e.g. H63D,

   - compound heterozygosity for H63D and C282 is associated with iron overload

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - transferrin saturation initially \uparrow
 - followed by \uparrow serum ferritin
   - reflects increasing iron overload.
 - Genetic testing of HFE should be performed when:
   - transferrin saturation is above 45%
   - serum ferritin is elevated:
     - >200 ng/ml in adult females
     - >300 ng/ml in adult males

***  Treatment and Prognosis

 - At least half of all male and female C282Y homozygotes have normal
   serum ferritin levels and may never require therapy.
 - Many have moderately elevated serum ferritin levels  (200-1000 ng/ml)
   - it is unclear at present whether all should have regular
     phlebotomies to reduce systemic iron load.
 - serum ferritin levels exceeding 1000 ng/ml a phlebotomy regimen is clearly
   necessary.
   - In adults initially 500 ml blood is removed weekly or bi-weekly.
   - Phlebotomy frequency is usually reduced to once every 3-6 months
     when serum ferritin levels are below 50 ng/ml.


** Systemic Iron Overload Syndromes
*** Juvenile Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 2)
 - the most severe type of hereditary haemochromatosis
   - probably because hepcidin deficiency is more pronounced
 - Patients present in the 2nd and 3rd decade
   - mostly w hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and cardiomyopathy due to
     iron overload.
 - Type 2A is caused by mutations in the HJV gene encoding for hemojuvelin
   - necessary for proper hepcidin synthesis
 - Type 2B from mutations in the HAMP gene encoding hepcidin.
 - Serum ferritin is high and transferrin iron saturation elevated, as in classic
   HFE-related haemochromatosis.
 - A final diagnosis is made by mutation analysis
 - Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice and may prevent organ damage
   if initiated early.

*** TFR2-Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 3)
 - Transferrin Receptor 2 (TFR2 gene) is important for sensing the
   intracellular iron status (e.g erythroid cells)
 - Mutations result in iron overload phenotype which resembles classic, HFE-related haemochromatosis
   - patients are generally younger
 - Low hepcidin levels along with elevated transferrin iron saturation,
   elevated ferritin and high liver iron content are present.
 - Mutation analysis leads to the correct diagnosis in the absence of
   the classic haemochromatosis genotype.
 - Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice.

*** Ferroportin Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 4)
 - Differs in several ways from the other three subtypes of haemochromatosis.
 - AD inheritance and caused by mutations in SLC40A1, encoding ferroportin
 - Expressed at the enterocyte and plasma membrane of macrophages.
 - Loss of function mutations impair the export of iron from macrophages causing an iron
   deficiency in erythrocytic precursors.
 - Patients present with a combination of mild microcytic anaemia with
   low transferrin saturation
   - iron overload predominantly in macrophages.
 - Tolerance to phlebotomy is limited by the concurrent anaemia.
 - In contrast, gain of function mutations cause resistance to feedback
   inhibition by hepcidin.
   - These patients present with a more classic hepatic iron overload
     haemochromatosis phenotype.

*** Neonatal Haemochromatosis
 - Once thought to be an AR inherited disorder, now recognized as acquired
   - Any disease state that chronically prevents the synthesis or
     activity of hepcidin will lead to haemochromatosis.
 - Patients present in the first few weeks of life with severe liver
   failure.
 - Caused by a maternal allo-immune reaction to the infant liver
   - starts /in utero/.
 - Liver injury leads to a decrease in hepcidin
   - manifests as severe siderosis of both liver and extrahepatic organs.
 - The diagnosis is made in any child with neonatal liver failure in
   combination with high serum ferritin and extrahepatic siderosis,
   - shown by MRI and/or oral mucosal biopsy
   - iron deposits in minor salivary glands in patients with NH.
 - Therapy is by exchange transfusion in combination with IVIGs to remove/bind maternally derived IgG
 - May a role for simultaneous antioxidant therapy
 - The risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy from a mother who
   has given birth to an affected child is as high as 90%.
   - Recurrence risk reduced by IVIGs during pregnancy

** Iron Deficiency and Distribution Disorders
*** Iron-Refractory Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IRIDA)
 - This disease is caused by a deficiency of matriptase-2, encoded by TMPRSS6.
 - If a mutation in both copies of this gene is present the normal cleavage of haemojuvelin is interrupted,
   - results in high hepcidin levels.
     - This will result in iron deficiency, low transferrin saturation
       (<10%) and microcytic anaemia at a young age [41].
 - Oral iron supplementation is not effective, as high hepcidin
   levels will prevent iron release from the enterocytes
   - requires intravenous iron therapy

*** Atransferrinaemia
 - First described in 1961, very few cases of atransferrinaemia have thus far been described.
 - AR disorder, mutations in TF,
 - present with moderate to severe hypochromic microcytic anaemia and growth retardation along with signs of haemochromatosis.
 - \downarrown serum transferrin
 - \uparrow serum ferritin 
 - Plasma infusions to increase the transferrin pool, represent an
   effective treatment

*** Hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia with Iron Overload Type 1

 - Hypochromic microcytic anaemia with iron overload type 1 is caused
   by mutations in SLC11A2 , encoding DMT1.
 - One of the isoforms of DMT1 is responsible for removing iron from
   absorbed transferrin in erythroid cells.
 - Patients present at a young age with microcytic anaemia in combination with
   mild hepatic iron overload.
 - Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels are elevated.
 - With erythropoietin (EPO) treatment regular transfusions can often be avoided


*** Hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia with Iron Overload Type 2

 - This subtype is caused by mutations in STEAP3.
 - STEAP3, is an endosomal ferrireductase which facilitates the
   transferrin mediated uptake of iron.
 - In the 3 siblings reported thus far, anaemia was present from early
   childhood,
 - While patients became transfusion dependent several years
 - Later, usually in late childhood.
 - High ferritin levels, together with low transferrin and increased
   transferrin saturation were found.
 - The degree of liver iron overload varied, all 3 had hypogonadism.
