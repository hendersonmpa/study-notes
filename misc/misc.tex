\section{Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism}
\label{sec:orgeb22876}
\subsection{Purine Metabolism}
\label{sec:org49dcfb6}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgfd880c9}
\begin{itemize}
\item Purine nucleotides are involved in energy transfer, metabolic
regulation, and synthesis of DNA and RNA
\item Purine metabolism can be divided into three pathways:
\begin{itemize}
\item biosynthetic pathway, often termed \emph{de novo}
\begin{itemize}
\item starts with the formation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP)
and leads to the synthesis of IMP
\item IMP interconversions to AMP and GMP
\item go on to di- and triphosphates, to and deoxyribonucleotides
\end{itemize}
\item catabolic pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item starts from GMP, IMP and AMP
\item produces uric acid , a poorly soluble compound, which tends to
crystallize once its plasma \(\ge\) 0.4 mmol/L
\end{itemize}
\item salvage pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item utilizes the purine bases guanine, hypoxanthine and adenine
\begin{itemize}
\item provided by food or the catabolic pathway
\end{itemize}
\item converts them into GMP, IMP and AMP
\item salvage of purine nucleosides, adenosine and guanosine, and
their deoxy counterparts, catalyzed by kinases, also occurs.
\item also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
nucleoside analogs into their active forms
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item inborn errors of purine metabolism comprise defects or
superactivities of:

\begin{itemize}
\item purine nucleotide synthesis and interconversions:
\begin{itemize}
\item phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) superactivity and deficiency
\item adenylosuccinase (ADSL) deficiency
\item AICA-ribosiduria caused by ATIC deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item purine catabolism:
\begin{itemize}
\item muscle AMP deaminase (AMPD, also termed myoadenylate deaminase)
\item adenylate kinase (AK)
\item adenosine deaminase (ADA)
\item purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)
\item xanthine oxidase (XO)
\end{itemize}
\item purine salvage:
\begin{itemize}
\item hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)
\item adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)
\item adenosine kinase (ADK)
\end{itemize}
\item deficiency of deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) causes mitochondrial DNA depletion
\item deficiency of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) results in
less efficient methylation and hence in enhanced toxicity of
pharmacologic thiopurine ana logs
\item deficiency of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (IT-Pase) also
increases the toxicity of thiopurines
\end{itemize}
\item With the exception of the deficiencies of muscle AMPD and TPMT, all
these inborn errors are very rare
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate Synthetase Superactivity}
\label{sec:org422449f}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org95ac910}
\begin{itemize}
\item gouty arthritis and/or uric acid lithiasis in young males
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:orgdde57a1}
\ce{ribose-5-phosphate + ATP ->[PRPS] PRPP}

\begin{itemize}
\item PRPP is the first intermediate in \emph{de novo} synthesis of purine nucleotides
\item PRPP synthetase is highly regulated
\item Two proposed mechanisms to explain PRS-I superactivity:
\begin{enumerate}
\item gain-of-function point mutations in the PRPS1 gene resulting in an
altered regulatory site
\item \(\uparrow\) expression of PRPS1 with normal kinetic properties
\end{enumerate}
\item PRPP amidotransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme
of the de novo pathway, is physiologically not saturated by PRPP,
the synthesis of purine nucleotides increases, and hence the
production of uric acid
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org31c88e9}
\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org8d890e1}
\begin{itemize}
\item extensive kinetic studies of the enzyme in erythrocytes and cultured
fibroblasts is performed in only a few laboratories in the world
\item molecular testing of PRPS1 gene
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org826b656}
\begin{itemize}
\item treated with allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, the last
enzyme of purine catabolism
\item results in a decrease of the production of uric acid and in its
replacement by
\begin{itemize}
\item hypoxanthine which is about 10-fold more soluble
\item xanthine which is slightly more soluble
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Adenosine Deaminase 1 Deficiency}
\label{sec:org15dc1ba}
\begin{itemize}
\item two isoforms of adenosine deaminase (ADA)
\begin{itemize}
\item ADA1 is found in most cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages
\item ADA2 is predominant in plasma
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org821b62c}
\begin{itemize}
\item clinical spectrum is very broad
\begin{itemize}
\item from a profound impairment of both humoral and cellular immunity
in infants, known as severe combined immunodeficienc (SCID)
\item to delayed and less severe later onset in older children or
adults
\item even benign partial ADA1 deficiency in adults
\end{itemize}
\item \textasciitilde{} 80\% of patients display, within the first weeks or months after
birth
\item multiple, recurrent opportunistic infections caused by a variety of
organisms, which rapidly become life-threatening.
\item infections are mainly localized in the skin, the respiratory,and the
gastrointestinal tract
\item in affected children over 6 months of age hypoplasia or apparent
absence of lymphoid tissue (tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus shadow on x-ray)
\item nonimmunological symptoms are also found
\begin{itemize}
\item 50\% have bone abnormalities
\item cognitive, behavioural, and neurological abnormalities can present
\begin{itemize}
\item lower IQ, hyperactivity, attention deficits, spasticity, head
lag, nystagmus, inability to focus, and high frequency
sensorineural deafness
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org1082150}
\begin{itemize}
\item accumulation in body fluids of adenosine and deoxyadenosine
\begin{itemize}
\item normally nearly undetectable
\end{itemize}
\item these compounds induce the premature death of lymphoid progenitor
cells, and thereby profoundly impair the generation of T, B, and NK
lymphocytes.
\item ADA deficiency affects to varying extent bone, brain, lung and liver
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:orgffa3e85}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR, ADA1
\begin{itemize}
\item \textasciitilde{} 40\% of SCID
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org22856fa}
\begin{itemize}
\item SCID can be confirmed by relatively simple laboratory tests:
\begin{itemize}
\item lymphopenia involving B, T and natural killer (NK) cells
\item hypogammaglobulinemia
\item IgM deficiency may be detected early
\item IgG deficiency becomes manifest only after the age of 3 months
when the maternal supply has been exhausted
\end{itemize}
\item the disease is progressive, since residual B- and T-cell function
which may be found at birth, disappears later on.

\item The enzymatic diagnosis is mostly confirmed on red blood cells
\item severity of disease correlates with the loss of ADA1 activity:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0-1\% activity in children with neonatal onset
\item 1-5\% activity in individuals with later onset
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org9ca6788}
\begin{itemize}
\item HSCT
\item ERT - PEG-ADA1
\item gene therapy
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Deficiency}
\label{sec:org3f2b230}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:orgd779e67}
\begin{itemize}
\item recurrent infections are usually of later onset
\item starting from the end of the first year to up to 5–6 years of age
\item initially less severe than in ADA1 deficiency
\item 2/3 have neurologic symptoms
\begin{itemize}
\item spastic tetra- or diplegia, ataxia and tremor, and mild to severe
mental retardation
\end{itemize}
\item 1/3 have autoimmune disorders
\begin{itemize}
\item hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and
autoimmune neutropenia
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:orgdf75ffe}
\begin{itemize}
\item accumulation of four PDP substrates:
\begin{itemize}
\item guanosine, deoxyguanosine, inosine, deoxyinosine
\end{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) formation of uric acid
\item T-cells accumulate dGTP \(\to\) impaired immunity
\begin{itemize}
\item dGTP is formed from deoxyguanosine and inhibits ribonucleotide
reductase, and hence cell division.
\end{itemize}
\item ubiquitous expression of PNP explains the presence of nonimmunologic
symptoms in its deficiency.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:orgbab087d}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org4aee268}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) plasma uric acid
\item \(\downarrow\) urine uric acid

\item other causes of hypouricemia such as xanthine oxidase deficiency,
and drug administration (acetylsalicylic acid, thiazide diuretics),
should be ruled out.
\item enzymatic diagnosis of PNP deficiency is usually performed on red
blood cells
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:orgea081d3}
\begin{itemize}
\item bone marrow transplantation
\item repeated transfusions of normal, irradiated erythrocytes
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Xanthine Oxidase Deficiency}
\label{sec:orgdd80c3b}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Picture
\label{sec:orgc01bdcc}
\begin{itemize}
\item three types of deficiencies of xanthine oxidase
\item all cause xanthinuria
\begin{enumerate}
\item type I classi cal xanthinuria
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by isolated XO deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item type II classical xanthinuria
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency of both XO and aldehyde oxidase (AO)
\end{itemize}
\item combined deficiency of XO, AO and sulfite oxidase
\end{enumerate}
\item type I and type II xanthinuria can be completely asymptomatic
\item about 1/3 of cases kidney stones are formed
\item myopathy w pain, stiffness
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org2c4d36d}
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency of XO results in the near total replacement of uric acid,
in plasma and urine, by hypoxanthine and xanthine as the end
products of purine catabolism
\item plasma hypoxanthine is not or minimally elevated
\begin{itemize}
\item due to reutilization by hypoxanthine-guanine phospho-ribosyltransferase
\end{itemize}
\item plasma xanthine \(\uparrow\) 10x

\item deficiency of AO \(\to\) inability to metabolize synthetic purine
analogues - allopurinol
\item The combined deficiency of XO, AO, and SO is caused by failure to
synthesize a molybdenum cofactor (MoCo), common to the three
oxidases
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orgfbfaa6d}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) plasma uric acid
\item \(\downarrow\) urine uric acid
\item \(\Uparrow\) plasma xanthine
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:orgc47c6db}
\begin{itemize}
\item Type I and II XO deficiency are mostly benign
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) purine diet w \(\uparrow\) fluid intake to prevent renal stones.
\end{itemize}
\item The prognosis of combined XO,AO and SO deficiency improved by daily
infusion of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase}
\label{sec:orgfa25148}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:orgac05be4}
\begin{itemize}
\item clinical spectrum of this disorder is very wide and determined by
the residual activity of the enzyme
\item Lesch-Nyhan syndrome = complete or near-complete deficiency of HPRT
\item affected children generally appear normal during the first months of
life.
\item at 3 to 6 months of age, a neurological syndrome evolves
\begin{itemize}
\item classified as severe action dystonia, superimposed on a baseline hypotonia.
\end{itemize}
\item Patients develop a striking neuro-psychological profile comprising:
\begin{itemize}
\item compulsive self-destructive behaviour involving biting of their
fingers and lips
\item physical and verbal aggression
\end{itemize}
\item Speech is hampered by athetoid dysarthria
\item most patients have IQ’s around 60–70, some display normal intelligence.
\item form uric acid stones.
\item if untreated, the uric acid nephrolithiasis progresses to
obstructive uropathy and renal failure during the first decade of
life
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:orgee2f10f}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\Uparrow\) production of uric acid due to \(\uparrow\) \emph{de novo} synthesis
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by \(\uparrow\) PRPP, which is not recycled by HPRT
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic
\label{sec:org7e52c4d}
\begin{itemize}
\item XLR, HPRT
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orgf4b3c81}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\Uparrow\) urine and plasma uric acid
\begin{itemize}
\item uric acid/creatinine
\end{itemize}
\item patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome display nearly undetectable
HPRT activity in red blood cells
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment and Prognosis
\label{sec:org167cb7c}
\begin{itemize}
\item allopurinol prevents urate nephropathy.
\begin{itemize}
\item even when given from birth or in combination with adenine has no
effect on the neurological symptoms
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pyrimidine Metabolism}
\label{sec:org36a299f}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgd78a230}
\begin{itemize}
\item metabolism of the pyrimidine nucleotides can be divided into three
pathways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item biosynthetic \emph{de novo} pathway:
\begin{itemize}
\item starts with the formation of carbamoylphosphate by cytosolic
carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS II)
\item followed by the synthesis of UMP, CMP and TMP
\end{itemize}
\item catabolic pathway:
\begin{itemize}
\item starts from CMP, UMP and TMP
\item yields \(\beta\)-alanine and \(\beta\)-aminoisobutyrate
\item converted into intermediates of TCA cycle
\end{itemize}
\item salvage pathway:
\begin{itemize}
\item composed of kinases
\item converts pyrimidine nucleosides, cytidine, uridine, and
thymidine \(\to\) CMP, UMP, and TMP
\item also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
nucleoside analogs into their active forms
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism comprise defects of:
\begin{itemize}
\item pyrimidine synthesis:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{UMP Synthase Deficiency}
\label{sec:org946a50d}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:orgaa04222}
\begin{itemize}
\item megaloblastic anaemia a few weeks or months after birth
\begin{itemize}
\item usually the first manifestation
\end{itemize}
\item peripheral blood smears often show anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and
moderate hypochromia
\item bone marrow examination reveals erythroid hyperplasia and numerous
megaloblastic erythroid precursors
\item characteristically, the anemia does not respond to iron, folic acid
or vitamin B 12
\item unrecognized, the disorder leads to FTT and to retardation of growth
and psychomotor development
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:orgf9a6ba4}

\begin{itemize}
\item UMP synthase is a bifunctional enzyme of the \emph{de novo} synthesis of
pyrimidines
\item first reaction, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT),converts
orotic acid into OMP
\item second, orotidine-5’-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC),
decarboxylates OMP into UMP
\item deficiency \(\to\) massive overproduction of orotic acid
\begin{itemize}
\item due to \(\downarrow\) feedback inhibition exerted by the pyrimidine
nucleotides on the first enzyme of their \emph{de novo synthesis} CPS2
and deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides
\end{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) pyrimidine nucleotides \(\to\) \(\downarrow\) cell division \(\to\) megaloblastic anemia

\end{itemize}
\item adult, partial
\begin{itemize}
\item found in adults who receive pyrimidine analog, 5-fluorouracil
\begin{itemize}

diarrhea and neurologic symptoms, including ataxia, paralysis
and stupor
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
