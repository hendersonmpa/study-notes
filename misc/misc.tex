\section{Neurotransmission}
\label{sec:org0d15bad}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgb475841}
\begin{itemize}
\item classical neurotransmitter systems involve:
\begin{itemize}
\item inhibitory
\begin{description}
\item[{aminoacidergic}] \(\gamma\)-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine
\end{description}
\item excitatory
\begin{description}
\item[{aminoacidergic}] aspartate and glutamate
\item[{cholinergic}] acetylcholine
\item[{monoaminergic}] adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin
\item[{purinergic}] adenosine and adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Addition of
\begin{itemize}
\item neuro-peptides the largest family of signalling molecules in the nervous system
\item channels that modulate neurotransmitter actions
\item new approaches based on synaptic physiology will likely reclassify
neurotransmitter systems and disorders in the future.
\end{itemize}

\item GABA is formed from glutamic acid by glutamic acid decarboxylase
\item catabolized into succinic acid through the sequential action of two
mitochondrial enzymes:
\begin{itemize}
\item GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
\end{itemize}
\item Glutamic acid decarboxylase and GABA transaminase require pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme
\item Pyridoxal phosphate also participates in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin
\begin{itemize}
\item and many other pathways including the glycine cleavage system
\end{itemize}
\item GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter present in high concentration in the CNS
\begin{itemize}
\item predominantly in the gray matter
\end{itemize}
\item GABA modulates brain activity by binding to
sodium-independent,high-affinity, mostly GABA A receptors
\item Glycine is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS
\item The inhibitory glycine receptors are mostly found in the brain stem
and spinal cord
\item Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain
\item Its function requires rapid uptake to replenish intracellular
neuronal pools following extracellular release

\item Inborn errors of neurotransmission include neurotransmitter
metabolism, receptor and transporter defects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Three defects of GABA catabolism have been reported (section \ref{sec:org738bd96})
\item Three receptor defects (section \ref{sec:org891f7ad})
\item Three transportopathies are reported section \ref{sec:org891f7ad})
\item Six disorders of monoamine metabolism (section \ref{sec:orgf2bf51f})
\item See aminoacidopathies for disorders of glycine metabolism
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{GABA catabolism}
\label{sec:org738bd96}
\begin{itemize}
\item Three defects of GABA catabolism have been reported:
\begin{enumerate}
\item GABA transaminase deficiency (very rare, severe, and untreatable)
\item succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency
\item homocarnosinosis
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Brain metabolism of GABA: 1 glutamic acid decarboxylase; 2 GABA transaminase; 3 succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency}
\label{sec:org3b0985b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD) was first
reported as \(\gamma\)-hydroxybutyric aciduria (4-hydroxybutyric aciduria)
\item the most prevalent of the disorders of GABA metabolism
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org3d931ed}
\begin{itemize}
\item non specific clinical manifestations including:
\begin{itemize}
\item developmental delay and early-onset hypotonia
\item later-onset expressive language impairment
\item obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder
\item hyporeflexia, non-progressive ataxia, and epilepsy
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org05919f7}
\begin{itemize}
\item key feature is an accumulation of \(\gamma\)-hydroxybutyrate in urine,
plasma, and CSF
\item \(\gamma\)-hydroxybutyrate and GABA (\(\uparrow\) 3x in CSF) are
neuropharmacologically active compounds
\item additional biochemical abnormalities relate to GABA, succinic semialdehyde, and GHB
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) homocarnosine in CSF
\item \(\uparrow\) guanidinobutyrate in CSF
\item \(\uparrow\) D-2-hydroxyglutarate
\item \(\uparrow\) succinic semialdehyde
\item \(\uparrow\) 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid
\end{itemize}
\item Many of these intermediates likely derive from succinic semialdehyde
\item \(\downarrow\) glutathione, the major intracellular antioxidant
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:orgdc90632}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR, ALDH5A1
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orgbdfdff2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) \(\gamma\)-hydroxybutyric acid in urine
\item followed by molecular diagnosis via sequencing of ALDH5A1
\item Concomitant identification of 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid , both the
free and lactone form (threo-, erythro-) in the organic acid profile
is highly suggestive
\item GHB is also employed clinically (Xyrem R (sodium saltof GHB); for
cataplexy) and illicitly (for induction of euphoria)
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment and Prognosis
\label{sec:org5d63f63}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sudden death can occur in patients often in association with
epilepsy (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy or SUDEP)
\item therapeutic intervention has historically employed vigabatrin
(Sabril R ; gamma-vinyl GABA)
\begin{itemize}
\item an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase
\end{itemize}
\item beneficial in some but without efficacy in others
\item remains to be determined whether enhancing GABA levels in SSADHD
(which are already elevated) is prudent, and the visual field
disturbances associated with vigabatrin are treatment limiting
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Receptors and Transporters of Neurotransmitters}
\label{sec:org891f7ad}
\begin{itemize}
\item receptors defects:
\begin{itemize}
\item hyperekplexia is usually due to a dominantly inherited defect of the
\(\alpha\) 1 subunit of the glycine receptor which causes excessive
startle responses, and is treatable with clonazepam
\item mutations in GABA A receptor are a cause of dominantly inherited
epilepsy
\item mutations in glutamate receptors associate with neurodevelopmental
and psychiatric disorders
\end{itemize}
\item three transportopathies are reported:
\begin{itemize}
\item mitochondrial glutamate transporter defect
\begin{itemize}
\item a cause of severe epileptic encephalopathy
\end{itemize}
\item diseases that produce early parkinsonism-dystonia:
\begin{itemize}
\item dopamine transporter defect
\item vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 defect
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Monoamine Metabolism}
\label{sec:orgf2bf51f}
\begin{itemize}
\item The monoamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin,
are metabolites of the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan
\item The first step in their formation is catalysed by
amino-acid-specific hydroxylases, which require tetrahydrobiopterin (BH\(_{\text{4}}\)) as a cofactor
\item BH\(_{\text{4}}\) is also a cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase
\item Its synthesis from GTP is initiated by the rate-limiting GTP
cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH-I), which forms dihydroneopterin
triphosphate (NH2TP)
\item L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are meabolized by a common
B6-dependent aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) into
dopamine (the precursor of the catecholamines, adrenaline and
noradrenaline) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), respectively
\item Adrenaline and noradrenaline are catabolized into vanillylmandelic
acid (VMA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) via
monoamino oxidase A (MAO-A)
\item MOA-A is also involved in the catabolism of both dopamine into
homovanillic acid (HVA) via 3-methoxytyramine, and of serotonin into
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
\item Dopaminergic modulation of ion fluxes regulates emotion, activity,
behaviour, nerve conduction, and the release of a number of hormones
via G-protein-coupled cell-surface dopamine
receptors.
\item Serotoninergic neurotransmission modulates body temperature, blood
pressure, endocrine secretion, appetite, sexual behaviour, movement,
emesis, and pain.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Six disorders of monoamine metabolism:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency
\begin{itemize}
\item impairs synthesis of dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) and causes
a neurological disease with prominent extrapyramidal signs, and
a variable response to L-dopa.
\item \(\uparrow\) HVA, MHPG, and 5-HIAA in the CSF
\item The HVA/5HIAA ratio in CSF is the most sensitive marker not only
for diagnosis but also to identify the severity of the phenotype
\end{itemize}
\item dopamine \(\beta\)-hydroxylase deficiency
\begin{itemize}
\item severe orthostatic hypotension with sympathetic failure
\item \(\Downarrow\) plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline

(5-HTP) with normal baseline phenylalaninemia and effective
treatment (especially GTPCH-I deficiency)
\item GTPCH-I labs

\section{Peptides}
\label{sec:orga6a0949}
\subsection{TMA and Choline}
\label{sec:org68237a7}
\subsubsection{Trimethylamine Metabolism}
\label{sec:org5480f63}
\begin{itemize}
\item trimethylamine (TMA) is a volatile tertiary amine which smells of rotting fish
\item a bacterial metabolite which is produced by anaerobes resident
in the human colon from choline (present in lecithin), carnitine and
betaine, and from trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in salt water fish and shell-fish
\item TMA is absorbed from the intestine and oxidised in the liver by
flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), a microsomal NADPH-dependent enzyme.
\begin{itemize}
\item product is TMA-N-oxide (TMAO) which is non-odorous and is
excreted in urine
\end{itemize}
\item more than 90\% of the absorbed TMA is oxidised and the urinary output
of unmetabolised TMA in adults on a Western diet is only around 17-35 umol/24 h
\item FMO3 is not produced by the fetus after 15 weeks of gestation or,
usually, in the first month of life.
\item levels increase to around 8\% of adult values by nine months of age and 20\% by 11 years
\item FMO3 activity is inhibited by indoles from brassicas and is reduced perimenstrually
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Catabolism of Choline}
\label{sec:orgf2337c4}
\begin{itemize}

two methyl groups by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) and
sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH)
\item flavin enzymes with covalently linked FAD which use folate as co-factor
\item the methyl groups from dimethylglycine and sarcosine are transferred
to tetrahydrofolate (THF)

\end{itemize}
\item electrons are transferred from FAD \(\to\) electron transfer
flavoprotein (ETF) \(\to\) mito ETC

isoform which oxidises TMA
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org43b2878}
\begin{itemize}
\item common causes of abnormal body odour and urine infection are
excluded
\item random urine sample is collected if the odour is obvious, if not
menstruating

\item \(\uparrow\) [iron] \(\to\) \(\uparrow\) [circulating free iron]
\begin{itemize}
\item primarily taken up by the liver, the pancreas and the heart.
\item syndromes manifest with cirrhosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy.
\end{itemize}
\item Absorption of iron occurs primarily in the duodenum via the
divalent-metal transporter(DMT1)
\item The major recycling route for iron is removal from
erythrocytic haem by haemoxygenase
\begin{itemize}
\item in macrophages and enterocytes.
\end{itemize}
\item Circulating free iron binds to to apo-transferrin forming holo-transferrin
\item Transferrin can only bind iron in the ferric state
\item Ceruloplasmin catalyses the oxidization of Fe\(^{\text{2+}}\) into Fe\(^{\text{3+}}\)
\item The transferrin receptor mediates the uptake of transferrin
\item Iron is released from intracellular transferrin by a specific isoform of DMT1.
\item In several cell types, including macrophages, iron can be stored
bound to ferritin until needed.

\subsubsection{Classic Hereditary Haemochromatosis}
\label{sec:orgbc80919}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org87878d1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Also called Type 1 or HFE related haemochromatosis
\item An autosomal recessive disorder
\item Slow but progressive accumulation of iron in various organs
\item Clinically apparent by the fourth or fifth decade of life
\item Initial symptoms are nonspecific and include:
\begin{itemize}
\item fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss and arthralgia.
\end{itemize}
\item Increased awareness, and improved diagnostic testing
\begin{itemize}
\item Classic symptoms of full-blown haemochromatosis are rarely seen
\begin{itemize}
\item liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiomyopathy,
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, arthropathy and skin
pigmentation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:orgf1aa21f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Caused by a disturbance in iron homeostasis associated with hepcidin
deficiency and systemic accumulation of iron.
\item The exact role of HFE, is unclear at present.
\item Most probably it is essential for sensing iron levels and thus
indirectly for regulating hepcidin synthesis.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org5e46cd9}
\begin{itemize}
\item As many as 0.5\% of the Northern European population are homozygous
for the C282Y mutation in HFE,

\begin{itemize}
\item only 5\% of male and <1\% of female C282Y homozygotes eventually
develop liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.
\end{itemize}

\item Other mutations in HFE are also described, e.g. H63D,

\begin{itemize}
\item compound heterozygosity for H63D and C282 is associated with iron overload
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org096ae4a}
\begin{itemize}
\item transferrin saturation initially \(\uparrow\)
\item followed by \(\uparrow\) serum ferritin
\begin{itemize}
\item reflects increasing iron overload.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic testing of HFE should be performed when:
\begin{itemize}
\item transferrin saturation is above 45\%
\item serum ferritin is elevated:
\begin{itemize}
\item >200 ng/ml in adult females
\item >300 ng/ml in adult males
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment and Prognosis
\label{sec:org411c555}

\begin{itemize}
\item At least half of all male and female C282Y homozygotes have normal
serum ferritin levels and may never require therapy.
\item Many have moderately elevated serum ferritin levels  (200-1000 ng/ml)
\begin{itemize}
\item it is unclear at present whether all should have regular
phlebotomies to reduce systemic iron load.
\end{itemize}
\item serum ferritin levels exceeding 1000 ng/ml a phlebotomy regimen is clearly
necessary.
\begin{itemize}
\item In adults initially 500 ml blood is removed weekly or bi-weekly.
\item Phlebotomy frequency is usually reduced to once every 3-6 months
when serum ferritin levels are below 50 ng/ml.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Systemic Iron Overload Syndromes}
\label{sec:orge177d0d}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Juvenile Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 2)
\label{sec:orgaef0cac}
\begin{itemize}
\item the most severe type of hereditary haemochromatosis
\begin{itemize}
\item probably because hepcidin deficiency is more pronounced
\end{itemize}
\item Patients present in the 2nd and 3rd decade
\begin{itemize}
\item mostly w hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and cardiomyopathy due to
iron overload.
\end{itemize}
\item Type 2A is caused by mutations in the HJV gene encoding for hemojuvelin
\begin{itemize}
\item necessary for proper hepcidin synthesis
\end{itemize}
\item Type 2B from mutations in the HAMP gene encoding hepcidin.
\item Serum ferritin is high and transferrin iron saturation elevated, as in classic
HFE-related haemochromatosis.
\item A final diagnosis is made by mutation analysis
\item Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice and may prevent organ damage
if initiated early.
\end{itemize}

\item TFR2-Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 3)
\label{sec:org842d60d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transferrin Receptor 2 (TFR2 gene) is important for sensing the
intracellular iron status (e.g erythroid cells)
\item Mutations result in iron overload phenotype which resembles classic, HFE-related haemochromatosis
\begin{itemize}
\item patients are generally younger
\end{itemize}
\item Low hepcidin levels along with elevated transferrin iron saturation,
elevated ferritin and high liver iron content are present.
\item Mutation analysis leads to the correct diagnosis in the absence of
the classic haemochromatosis genotype.
\item Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice.
\end{itemize}

\item Ferroportin Related Hereditary Haemochromatosis (Type 4)
\label{sec:org3ea5127}
\begin{itemize}
\item Differs in several ways from the other three subtypes of haemochromatosis.
\item AD inheritance and caused by mutations in SLC40A1, encoding ferroportin
\item Expressed at the enterocyte and plasma membrane of macrophages.
\item Loss of function mutations impair the export of iron from macrophages causing an iron
deficiency in erythrocytic precursors.
\item Patients present with a combination of mild microcytic anaemia with
low transferrin saturation
\begin{itemize}
\item iron overload predominantly in macrophages.
\end{itemize}
\item Tolerance to phlebotomy is limited by the concurrent anaemia.
\item In contrast, gain of function mutations cause resistance to feedback
inhibition by hepcidin.
\begin{itemize}
\item These patients present with a more classic hepatic iron overload
haemochromatosis phenotype.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Neonatal Haemochromatosis
\label{sec:org669785f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Once thought to be an AR inherited disorder, now recognized as acquired
\begin{itemize}
\item Any disease state that chronically prevents the synthesis or
activity of hepcidin will lead to haemochromatosis.
\end{itemize}
\item Patients present in the first few weeks of life with severe liver
failure.
\item Caused by a maternal allo-immune reaction to the infant liver
\begin{itemize}
\item starts \emph{in utero}.
\end{itemize}
\item Liver injury leads to a decrease in hepcidin
\begin{itemize}
\item manifests as severe siderosis of both liver and extrahepatic organs.
\end{itemize}
\item The diagnosis is made in any child with neonatal liver failure in
combination with high serum ferritin and extrahepatic siderosis,
\begin{itemize}
\item shown by MRI and/or oral mucosal biopsy
\item iron deposits in minor salivary glands in patients with NH.
\end{itemize}
\item Therapy is by exchange transfusion in combination with IVIGs to remove/bind maternally derived IgG
\item May a role for simultaneous antioxidant therapy
\item The risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy from a mother who
has given birth to an affected child is as high as 90\%.
\begin{itemize}
\item Recurrence risk reduced by IVIGs during pregnancy
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Iron Deficiency and Distribution Disorders}
\label{sec:org3489d98}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Iron-Refractory Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IRIDA)
\label{sec:org1c725fb}
\begin{itemize}
\item This disease is caused by a deficiency of matriptase-2, encoded by TMPRSS6.
\item If a mutation in both copies of this gene is present the normal cleavage of haemojuvelin is interrupted,
\begin{itemize}
\item results in high hepcidin levels.
\begin{itemize}
\item This will result in iron deficiency, low transferrin saturation
(<10\%) and microcytic anaemia at a young age [41].
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Oral iron supplementation is not effective, as high hepcidin
levels will prevent iron release from the enterocytes
\begin{itemize}
\item requires intravenous iron therapy
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Atransferrinaemia
\label{sec:orga51847e}
\begin{itemize}
\item First described in 1961, very few cases of atransferrinaemia have thus far been described.
\item AR disorder, mutations in TF,
\item present with moderate to severe hypochromic microcytic anaemia and growth retardation along with signs of haemochromatosis.
\item \downarrown serum transferrin
\item \(\uparrow\) serum ferritin
\item Plasma infusions to increase the transferrin pool, represent an
effective treatment
\end{itemize}

\item Hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia with Iron Overload Type 1
\label{sec:org855e283}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hypochromic microcytic anaemia with iron overload type 1 is caused
by mutations in SLC11A2 , encoding DMT1.
\item One of the isoforms of DMT1 is responsible for removing iron from
absorbed transferrin in erythroid cells.
\item Patients present at a young age with microcytic anaemia in combination with
mild hepatic iron overload.
\item Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels are elevated.
\item With erythropoietin (EPO) treatment regular transfusions can often be avoided
\end{itemize}


\item Hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia with Iron Overload Type 2
\label{sec:org2fa6dbb}

\begin{itemize}
\item This subtype is caused by mutations in STEAP3.
\item STEAP3, is an endosomal ferrireductase which facilitates the
transferrin mediated uptake of iron.
\item In the 3 siblings reported thus far, anaemia was present from early
childhood,
\item While patients became transfusion dependent several years
\item Later, usually in late childhood.
\item High ferritin levels, together with low transferrin and increased
transferrin saturation were found.
\item The degree of liver iron overload varied, all 3 had hypogonadism.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism}
\label{sec:org7dde7b4}
\subsection{Purine Metabolism}
\label{sec:orgdc795db}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org5ebcfd6}
\begin{itemize}
\item Purine nucleotides are involved in energy transfer, metabolic
regulation, and synthesis of DNA and RNA
\item Purine metabolism can be divided into three pathways:
\begin{itemize}
\item biosynthetic pathway, often termed \emph{de novo}
\begin{itemize}
\item starts with the formation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP)
and leads to the synthesis of IMP
\item IMP interconversions to AMP and GMP
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\to\) di- and triphosphates and deoxyribonucleotides
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item catabolic pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item starts from GMP, IMP and AMP
\item produces uric acid , a poorly soluble compound, which tends to
crystallize once its plasma \(\ge\) 0.4 mmol/L
\end{itemize}
\item salvage pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item utilizes the purine bases guanine, hypoxanthine and adenine
\begin{itemize}
\item provided by food or the catabolic pathway
\end{itemize}
\item converts them into GMP, IMP and AMP
\item also salvage of purine nucleosides, adenosine and guanosine, and
their deoxy counterparts, catalyzed by kinases
\item also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
nucleoside analogs into their active forms
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item inborn errors of purine metabolism comprise defects or
superactivities of:

\begin{itemize}
\item purine nucleotide synthesis and interconversions:
\begin{itemize}
\item phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) superactivity and deficiency
\item adenylosuccinase (ADSL) deficiency
\item AICA-ribosiduria caused by ATIC deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item purine catabolism:
\begin{itemize}
\item muscle AMP deaminase (AMPD, also termed myoadenylate deaminase)
\item adenylate kinase (AK)
\item adenosine deaminase (ADA)
\item purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)
\item xanthine oxidase (XO)
\end{itemize}
\item purine salvage:
\begin{itemize}
\item hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)
\item adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)
\item adenosine kinase (ADK)
\end{itemize}
\item deficiency of deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) causes mitochondrial DNA depletion
\item deficiency of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) results in
less efficient methylation and hence in enhanced toxicity of
pharmacologic thiopurine ana logs
\item deficiency of inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (IT-Pase) also
increases the toxicity of thiopurines
\end{itemize}
\item With the exception of the deficiencies of muscle AMPD and TPMT, all
these inborn errors are very rare
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate Synthetase Superactivity}
\label{sec:org7f8219e}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org198f67c}
\begin{itemize}
\item gouty arthritis and/or uric acid lithiasis in young males
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org469fefe}
\begin{itemize}
\item PRPP is the first intermediate in \emph{de novo} synthesis of purine nucleotides
\end{itemize}
\ce{ribose-5-phosphate + ATP ->[PRPS] PRPP}
\begin{itemize}
\item PRPP synthetase is highly regulated
\item Two proposed mechanisms to explain PRPS1 superactivity:
\begin{enumerate}
\item gain-of-function point mutations in the PRPS1 gene resulting in an
altered regulatory site
\item \(\uparrow\) expression of PRPS1 with normal kinetic properties
\end{enumerate}
\item PRPP amidotransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme
of the de novo pathway, is physiologically not saturated by PRPP,
the synthesis of purine nucleotides increases, and hence the
production of uric acid
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org3e61a4b}
\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked, PRPS1
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org4a712cd}
\begin{itemize}
\item extensive kinetic studies of the enzyme in erythrocytes and cultured
fibroblasts is performed in only a few laboratories in the world
\item molecular testing of PRPS1 gene
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org1f1897a}
\begin{itemize}
\item treated with allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, the last
enzyme of purine catabolism
\item results in a decrease of the production of uric acid and in its
replacement by
\begin{itemize}
\item hypoxanthine which is about 10-fold more soluble
\item xanthine which is slightly more soluble
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:orgdc20b71}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR
\item primary muscular deficiency the defect is caused by a c.34C->T mutation
\item results in a nonsense codon Q12X and a severely truncated, inactive enzyme
\item this mutant allele is found in 8-11\% of Caucasians
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org6c024e4}
\begin{itemize}
\item exercise test
\begin{itemize}
\item several-fold elevation of venous plasma ammonia, seen in normal
subjects, is absent in AMPD deficiency.

\begin{itemize}
\item ADA1 is found in most cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages
\item ADA2 is predominant in plasma
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:orgcd99baa}
\begin{itemize}
\item clinical spectrum is very broad
\begin{itemize}
\item from a profound impairment of both humoral and cellular immunity
in infants, known SCID
\item to delayed and less severe later onset in older children or
adults
\item even benign partial ADA1 deficiency in adults
\end{itemize}
\item \textasciitilde{} 80\% of patients display, within the first weeks or months after
birth
\item multiple, recurrent opportunistic infections caused by a variety of
organisms, which rapidly become life-threatening
\item infections are mainly localized in the skin, the respiratory, and the
gastrointestinal tract
\item in affected children over 6 months of age hypoplasia or apparent

\item non-immunological symptoms are also found
\begin{itemize}
\item 50\% have bone abnormalities
\item cognitive, behavioural, and neurological abnormalities can present
\begin{itemize}
\item lower IQ, hyperactivity, attention deficits, spasticity, head
lag, nystagmus, inability to focus, and high frequency
sensorineural deafness
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org57426a1}
\begin{itemize}
\item accumulation in body fluids of adenosine and deoxyadenosine
\begin{itemize}
\item normally \textasciitilde{}undetectable
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\ce{adenosine + H2O ->[ADA1] inosine + NH3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\to\) premature death of lymphoid progenitor cells

\begin{itemize}
\item AR, ADA1
\begin{itemize}
\item \textasciitilde{} 40\% of SCID
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org021e276}
\begin{itemize}
\item SCID can be confirmed by relatively simple laboratory tests:
\begin{itemize}
\item lymphopenia involving B, T and natural killer (NK) cells
\item hypogammaglobulinemia
\item IgM deficiency may be detected early
\item IgG deficiency becomes manifest only after the age of 3 months
when the maternal supply has been exhausted
\end{itemize}
\item the disease is progressive, since residual B- and T-cell function
which may be found at birth, disappears later on.

\item The enzymatic diagnosis is mostly confirmed on red blood cells
\item severity of disease correlates with the loss of ADA1 activity:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0-1\% activity in children with neonatal onset
\item 1-5\% activity in individuals with later onset
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org82eb007}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:orge88d689}
\begin{itemize}
\item accumulation of four PDP substrates:
\begin{itemize}
\item guanosine, deoxyguanosine, inosine, deoxyinosine
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\ce{purine nucleoside + phosphate ->[PNP] purine + alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) formation of uric acid
\item T-cells accumulate dGTP \(\to\) impaired immunity
\begin{itemize}
\item dGTP is formed from deoxyguanosine and inhibits ribonucleotide
reductase, and hence cell division.
\end{itemize}
\item ubiquitous expression of PNP explains the presence of nonimmunologic
symptoms in its deficiency.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org1e9cf2e}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests

\end{enumerate}
\item type I and type II xanthinuria can be completely asymptomatic
\item about 1/3 of cases kidney stones are formed
\item myopathy w pain, stiffness
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org87fa571}
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency of XO results in the near total replacement of uric acid,
in plasma and urine, by hypoxanthine and xanthine as the end
products of purine catabolism
\end{itemize}
\ce{hypoxanthine + H2O + O2 ->[XO] xanthine + H2O2}
\ce{xanthine + H2O + O2 ->[XO] uric acid + H2O2}
\begin{itemize}
\item plasma hypoxanthine is not or minimally elevated
\begin{itemize}
\item due to reutilization by hypoxanthine-guanine phospho-ribosyltransferase
\end{itemize}
\item plasma xanthine \(\uparrow\) 10x
\item deficiency of AO \(\to\) inability to metabolize synthetic purine
analogues - allopurinol
\item The combined deficiency of XO, AO, and SO is caused by failure to
synthesize a molybdenum cofactor (MoCo), common to the three
oxidases
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orga366f02}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) plasma uric acid

\begin{itemize}
\item Type I and II XO deficiency are mostly benign
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) purine diet w \(\uparrow\) fluid intake to prevent renal stones.
\end{itemize}
\item The prognosis of combined XO,AO and SO deficiency improved by daily
infusion of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP)
\end{itemize}

\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org39045dd}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lesch-Nyhan syndrome} = complete or near-complete deficiency of HPRT

life
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org80c0d72}
\begin{itemize}
\item HGPRT is a transferase that catalyzes conversion of:
\begin{itemize}
\item hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate
\item guanine to guanosine monophosphate
\end{itemize}
\item This reaction transfers the 5-phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to the purine
\item HGPRT plays a central role in the generation of purine nucleotides through the purine salvage pathway

\subsection{Pyrimidine Metabolism}
\label{sec:orgdb4f979}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orge8093dd}
\begin{itemize}
\item metabolism of the pyrimidine nucleotides can be divided into three
pathways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item biosynthetic \emph{de novo} pathway:
\begin{itemize}
\item starts with the formation of carbamoylphosphate by cytosolic
carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS II)
\item followed by the synthesis of UMP, CMP and TMP
\end{itemize}
\item catabolic pathway:
\begin{itemize}
\item starts from CMP, UMP and TMP
\item yields \(\beta\)-alanine and \(\beta\)-aminoisobutyrate
\item converted into intermediates of TCA cycle
\end{itemize}
\item salvage pathway:
\begin{itemize}
\item composed of kinases
\item converts pyrimidine nucleosides, cytidine, uridine, and
thymidine \(\to\) CMP, UMP, and TMP
\item also converts several pharmacological anticancer and antiviral
nucleoside analogs into their active forms
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism comprise defects of:
\begin{itemize}
\item pyrimidine synthesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item CAD (carbamoylphosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase) Deficiency
\item UMP synthase deficiency
\item Miller syndrome
\end{itemize}
\item pyrimidine catabolism:
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiencies of dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (DPD) dihydropyrimidinase (DHP)

\label{sec:org95cc0c4}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org8d667ac}
\begin{itemize}
\item porphyria is a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the
chemical steps that lead to heme production
\item heme is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver
\item heme is a component of several iron-containing proteins called
hemoproteins, including hemoglobin and the cytochrome P450 family of
enzymes
\item porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles composed of four modified
pyrrole subunits
\item interconnected at their \(\alpha\)-carbon atoms via methine bridges
(=CHâˆ’)
\item porphyrins are aromatic
\item Thus porphyrin macrocycles are highly conjugated systems
\item typically have very intense absorption bands in the visible region
and may be deeply colored
\item biosynthesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item organelle: mitochondria \(\to\) cytoplasm \(\to\) mitochondria
\begin{itemize}
\item Starts with succinyl-CoA and glycine in mitochondria
\end{itemize}
\item Tissue: 70-80\% in bone marrow
\begin{itemize}
\item 15\% in other tissue ie. liver \(\to\) Cyto P450, cytochromes

\item \(\uparrow\) ALA excretion secondary to inhibition of ALAD
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by lead displacing zinc at catalytic site
\item ALAD2 isoform more susceptible than ALAD1
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Secondary Coproporphyrinuria: Hepatobiliary and other Disorders}
\label{sec:orgee50c79}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most common cause of abnormal porphyrin excretion
\begin{description}
\item[{alcohol intake}] CIII
\item[{impaired biliary excretion of CI}] \(\to\) urine
\begin{itemize}
\item cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and cirrhosis
\item reversal of normal ratio: CI dominates
\item drugs
\item severe infection
\end{itemize}
\item[{Dubin-Johnson}] \(\uparrow\) CI, \(\downarrow\) CII
\item[{Rotor}] \(\uparrow\) CI, normal CIII
\item[{Gilbert}] \(\uparrow\) CI, \(\uparrow\) CIII
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Increased Fecal Porphyrin Concentration}
\label{sec:org813e904}
\begin{itemize}
\item protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins derived from
bacterial metabolism
\item additional protoporphyrin and other dicarboxylic porphyrins formed
from heme containing proteins from diet or gastrointestinal
hemorrhage
\item even minor hemorrhage (ie FOBT negative) \(\uparrow\) dicarboxylic porphyrins
\item Confusion with EPP may occur when associated iron deficiency
\(\uparrow\) erythrocyte total porphyrin, and skin lesions for other reasons
\item Confusion with VP when coexisting liver disease causes
coproporphyrinuria
\item Porphyria is excluded when no porphyrin fluorescence is detectable
on fluorescence emission spectroscopy of plasma and fecal
coproporphyrin excretion is normal
\item consumption of Brewers yeast caused profile indistinguishable from
VP
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Increase Plasma Porphyrin Concentration: Renal and other Disorders}
\label{sec:org049f9a3}
\begin{itemize}
\item plasma porphyrin concentration increased due to \(\downarrow\) renal or
hepatobiliary excretion is impaired
\item ESRF marked increase in concentration, poor clearance by dialysis
\begin{itemize}
\item similar to PCT, but not as high
\item PCT uncommon complicaiton of ESRF
\item distinguish with fecal porphyrin analysis
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hematologic Disorders}
\label{sec:org0c0bb84}
\begin{itemize}
\item iron deficiency anemia, Zn acts as alternate substrate for FECH
\begin{itemize}
\item results in \(\uparrow\) erythrocyte ZPP
\item also sideroblastic megaloblastic, and hemolytic anemias
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type I}
\label{sec:org46b5603}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) succinylacetone resembles ALA, inhibits ALAD
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) ALA accumulates in urine.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
