* Rett syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- \female Classic Rett syndrome :: a progressive neurodevelopmental
  disorder primarily affecting girls, is characterized by apparently
  normal psychomotor development during the first six to 18 months of
  life, followed by a short period of developmental stagnation, then
  rapid regression in language and motor skills, followed by long-term
  stability
- \male Severe neonatal-onset encephalopathy :: the most common
  phenotype in affected males, is characterized by a relentless
  clinical course that follows a metabolic-degenerative type of
  pattern, abnormal tone, involuntary movements, severe seizures, and
  breathing abnormalities. Death often occurs before age two years.
** Diagnostic Testing
- the diagnosis of a MECP2 disorder is established by molecular
  genetic testing in a female proband with suggestive findings and a
  heterozygous MECP2 pathogenic variant, and in a male proband with
  suggestive findings and a hemizygous MECP2 pathogenic variant.
** Genetic Counseling
- XL MECP2
- \gt 99% are simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family),
  resulting from a /de novo/ pathogenic variant or possibly from
  inheritance of the pathogenic variant from a parent who has germline
  mosaicism
* Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type IA
AKA Hereditary Neuropathy with Pressure Palsies
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by repeated focal pressure neuropathies such as carpal
  tunnel syndrome and peroneal palsy with foot drop
- first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade
- recovery from acute neuropathy is often complete; when recovery is
  not complete, the resulting disability is usually mild
- some affected individuals also have signs of a mild to moderate
  peripheral neuropathy
** Diagnostic Testing
- diagnosis of HNPP is established in an adult with recurrent focal
  compression neuropathies who has a family history consistent with
  autosomal dominant inheritance
- PMP22 is the only gene known to be associated with HNPP
- a contiguous gene deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 that includes PMP22
  is present in approximately 80% of affected individuals; the
  remaining 20% have a pathogenic variant in PMP22
** Genetic Counseling
- AD PMP22
* Spinal muscular atrophy
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy resulting from
  progressive degeneration and irreversible loss of the anterior horn
  cells in the spinal cord (i.e., lower motor neurons) and the brain
  stem nuclei
- onset of weakness ranges from before birth to adulthood
- weakness is symmetric, proximal \gt distal, and progressive
- used to be supportive care only now RNA therapy

** Diagnostic Testing
- established in a proband with a history of motor difficulties or
  regression, proximal muscle weakness, reduced/absent deep tendon
  reflexes, evidence of motor unit disease
- identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SMN1 on
  molecular genetic testing
- increases in SMN2 copy number often modify the phenotype
