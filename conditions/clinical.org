* Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy
** Clinical Characteristics
- The dystrophinopathies cover a spectrum of X-linked muscle disease
  ranging from mild to severe that includes Duchenne muscular
  dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and DMD-associated
  dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- The mild end of the spectrum includes the phenotypes of asymptomatic
  increase in serum concentration of creatine phosphokinase (CK) and
  muscle cramps with myoglobinuria
- The severe end of the spectrum includes progressive muscle diseases
  that are classified as Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy when
  skeletal muscle is primarily affected and as DMD-associated dilated
  cardiomyopathy (DCM) when the heart is primarily affected

*** DMD
- usually presents in early childhood with delayed motor milestones
  including delays in walking independently and standing up from a
  supine position
- proximal weakness causes a waddling gait and difficulty climbing
  stairs, running, jumping, and standing up from a squatting
  position
- rapidly progressive, with affected children being
  wheelchair dependent by age 12 years
- few survive beyond the third decade, with respiratory complications and
  progressive cardiomyopathy being common causes of death

*** BMD
- characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness
- heart failure is a common cause of morbidity and the most common
  cause of death in BMD
- mean age of death is in the mid-40s
*** DCM
- characterized by left ventricular dilation and congestive heart
  failure
- females heterozygous for a DMD pathogenic variant are at increased
  risk for DCM
** Diagnostic Testing
- \Uparrow CK
- DMD molecular
  - \male with hemizygous pathogenic variant 
  - \female with heterozygous pathogenic variant
** Genetic Counseling
- X-linked
- daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are heterozygous and
  may have a range of clinical manifestations
* Osteogenesis Imperfecta
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by fractures with minimal or absent trauma, variable
  dentinogenesis imperfecta
- four types
  - classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae
  - perinatally lethal OI
  - progressively deforming OI
  - common variable OI with normal sclerae

** Diagnostic Testing
- identification of a heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic
  variant in COL1A1 or COL1A2
** Genetic Counseling
- AD 
* Long QT Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- cardiac electrophysiologic disorder, characterized by QT
  prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that are associated
  with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade
  de pointes (TdP)
- TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the
  most common symptom in individuals with LQTS
- such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional
  stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning
- in some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and
  causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated)
  or sudden death
- approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant
  in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one
  to a few syncopal events
- cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are
  most common from the preteen years through the 20s
** Diagnostic Testing
- established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of
  specific conditions known to lengthen it
- diagnostic variants in one or more of the 15 genes known to be
  associated with LQTS
  - KCNH2 (LQT2), KCNQ1 (LQT1), and SCN5A (LQT3) are the most common
** Genetic Counseling
- AD
* Marfan Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- a systemic disorder of connective tissue with a high degree of
  clinical variability, comprises a broad phenotypic continuum ranging
  from mild to severe and rapidly progressive neonatal multiorgan
  disease

  cardiovascular systems
- normal life expectancy with proper management
** Diagnostic Testing
- one of the following sets of findings:

- FBN1 pathogenic variant known to be associated with Marfan syndrome
  AND one of the following:
  - aortic root enlargement
  - ectopia lentis
- aortic root enlargement and ectopia lentis OR a
  defined combination of features throughout the body

** Genetic Counseling

- ~ 50% have plexiform neurofibromas, but most are internal and not suspected clinically
- learning disabilities in ~ 50%
- Less common manifestations include optic nerve and other central
  nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors,
  scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and vasculopathy
** Diagnostic Testing
- usually based on clinical findings
- heterozygous pathogenic variants in NF1 are responsible for neurofibromatosis 1
- molecular genetic testing of NF1 is rarely needed for diagnosis
** Genetic Counseling
- AD, NF1
- 50% due to /de novo/ NF1 pathogenic variant
* Neurofibromatosis Type II
** Clinical Characteristics
- bilateral vestibular schwannomas with associated symptoms of tinnitus, hearing loss, and balance dysfunction
- average age of onset is 18 to 24 years
- almost all affected individuals develop bilateral vestibular
  schwannomas by age 30 years
- NF2 is considered an adult-onset disease
** Diagnostic Testing
-  consensus diagnostic criteria and/or by identification of a
  heterozygous pathogenic variant in NF2 on molecular genetic testing

** Genetic Counseling
- AD, NF2
- 50% with affected parent
- 50% due to /de novo/ NF2 pathogenic variant
- mosaic also possible
* Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- a congenital multiple-anomaly/cognitive impairment syndrome caused
  by an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism resulting from
  deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase
- characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth restriction,
  microcephaly, moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, and
  multiple major and minor malformations
- distinctive facial features, cleft palate, cardiac defects,
  underdeveloped external genitalia in males, postaxial polydactyly,
  and 2-3 syndactyly of the toes
- wide clinical spectrum
** Diagnostic Testing
- suggestive clinical features
- elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol level
- identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in DHCR7
- serum concentration of cholesterol is usually low
  - it may be in the normal range in approximately 10% of affected
    individuals \therefore unreliable for screening and diagnosis
** Genetic Counseling
- AR DHCR7
* Noonan Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- lentigines, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, short stature, pectus
  deformity, and dysmorphic facial features, including widely spaced
  eyes and ptosis
- multiple lentigines present as dispersed flat, black-brown macules,
  mostly on the face, neck and upper part of the trunk
  - do not appear until age four to five years but then increase to
    the thousands by puberty
** Diagnostic Testing
- clinical findings or, if clinical findings are insufficient, by
  identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of four
  genes
  - PTPN11, RAF1, BRAF, and MAP2K1
** Genetic Counseling
- AD 
* Charge Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- CHARGE is a mnemonic for coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia,
  retarded growth and development, genital abnormalities, and ear
  anomalies
- neonates with CHARGE syndrome often have multiple life-threatening
  medical conditions
- feeding difficulties are a major cause of
  morbidity in all age groups

  - FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, TCF12, and TWIST1
** Genetic Counseling
- AD
* Factor V Leiden Thrombophilia
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated protein
  C (APC) and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE)
- DVT is the most common VTE, with the legs being the most common
  site
** Diagnostic Testing
- a history of first and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE)
  manifest as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE),
  especially in women with a history of VTE during pregnancy or in
  association with use of estrogen-containing contraceptives
- a family history of recurrent thrombosis

- identification of a heterozygous or homozygous c.1691G>A variant in F5
  (the factor V Leiden variant)
  - in conjunction with coagulation tests
** Genetic Counseling

* G6PD deficiency
** Clinical Characteristics
- hemolytic anemia
  - results in paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the
    eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a
    rapid heart rate
- G6PD converts glucose-6-phosphate into
  6-phosphoglucono-\delta-lactone and is the rate-limiting enzyme of
  the PP pathway pathway that supplies reducing energy to cells by
  maintaining the level NADPH
- NADPH maintains the supply of reduced glutathione in the cells that
  is used to mop up free radicals that cause oxidative damage
** Diagnostic Testing
- CBC, Heinz bodies on film
- \uparrow LDH in hemolysis
- \downarrow haptoglobin
- Beutler spot test
** Genetic Counseling
- X-linked recessive G6PD

* Sickle Cell Disease
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by intermittent vaso-occlusive events and chronic
  hemolytic anemia
- vaso-occlusive events result in tissue ischemia leading to acute and
  chronic pain as well as organ damage that can affect any organ
  system, including the bones, spleen, liver, brain, lungs, kidneys,
  and joints
- dactylitis (pain and/or swelling of the hands or feet) is often the
  earliest manifestation
** Diagnostic Testing
- encompasses a group of disorders characterized by the presence of at
  least one hemoglobin S allele (HbS; p.Glu6Val in HBB) and a second
  HBB pathogenic variant resulting in abnormal hemoglobin
  polymerization
- Hb S/S (homozygous p.Glu6Val in HBB) accounts for 60-70% of SCD in
  the United States
- other forms of SCD result from coinheritance of HbS with other
  abnormal \beta-globin chain variants
  - the most common forms being
    - sickle-hemoglobin C disease (Hb S/C)
    - two types of sickle \beta-thalassemia
      - Hb S/\beta^+-thalassemia
      - Hb S/\beta^0-thalassemia
  - rarer forms result from coinheritance of other Hb variants such as
    D-Punjab, O-Arab, and E
- homozygous hemoglobin S alleles
  - sickle cell disease (Hb S/S)
- coinheritance of one hemoglobin S allele and a second HBB pathogenic variant
  - sickle-hemoglobin C disease (Hb S/C)
  - sickle \beta-thalassemia (Hb S/\beta^+-thalassemia and Hb S/\beta^0-thalassemia)
  - sickle-hemoglobin D, O, and E disease (or other beta globin chain variants)
** Genetic Counseling
- AR HBB
* \alpha-Thalassemia
** Clinical Characteristics
- two clinically significant forms:
  - hemoglobin Bart hydrops fetalis (Hb Bart) syndrome, caused by
    deletion of all four \alpha-globin genes
    - characterized by fetal onset of generalized edema, pleural and
      pericardial effusions, and severe hypochromic anemia, in the
      absence of ABO or Rh blood group incompatibility
    - additional clinical features include marked hepatosplenomegaly,
      extramedullary erythropoiesis, hydrocephalus, and cardiac and
      urogenital defects
    - death usually occurs in the neonatal period
  - hemoglobin H (HbH) disease, most frequently caused by deletion of
    three \alpha-globin genes 
    - characterized by microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia,
      splenomegaly, mild jaundice, and sometimes thalassemia-like bone
      changes
    - individuals with HbH disease may develop gallstones and
      experience acute episodes of hemolysis in response to oxidant
      drugs and infections
** Diagnostic Testing
- diagnosis of Hb Bart syndrome is established in a fetus with the
  characteristic radiographic and laboratory features
  - identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HBA1 and HBA2
    that result in deletion or inactivation of all four \alpha-globin
    alleles confirms the diagnosis
- diagnosis of HbH disease is established in a proband with the
  characteristic laboratory and clinical features
  - identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HBA1 and HBA2
    that result in deletion or inactivation of three \alpha-globin
    alleles confirms the diagnosis

* \beta-Thalassemia
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by reduced synthesis of the hemoglobin beta chain that
  results in microcytic hypochromic anemia, an abnormal peripheral
  blood smear with nucleated red blood cells, and reduced amounts of
  hemoglobin A (HbA) on hemoglobin analysis
- individuals with thalassemia major have severe anemia and
  hepatosplenomegaly
- usually come to medical attention within the first two years of
  life
- without treatment, affected children have severe failure to thrive
  and shortened life expectancy
- treatment with a regular transfusion program and chelation therapy,
  aimed at reducing transfusion iron overload, allows for normal
  growth and development and may improve the overall prognosis
** Diagnostic Testing
- red blood cell indices that reveal microcytic hypochromic anemia,
  nucleated red blood cells on peripheral blood smear
- hemoglobin analysis that reveals decreased amounts of HbA and
  increased amounts of hemoglobin F (HbF) after age 12 months
- clinical severity of anemia
- identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HBB
** Genetic Counseling
- AR HBB
  - carrier thalassemia minor
* Hemophilia A
** Clinical Characteristics
- deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in
  prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and
  delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing.

- age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to
  the level of factor VIII clotting activity.

  - severe hemophilia A ::  2 - 5 spontaneous bleeding episodes each month
    - are usually diagnosed during the first 2 years of life following
      bleeding from minor injuries.
    - spontaneous joint bleeds or deep-muscle hematomas,
    - prolonged bleeding or excessive pain and swelling from minor
      injuries, surgery, and tooth extractions.

  - moderate hemophilia A :: seldom have spontaneous bleeding;
    - prolonged or delayed oozing after relatively minor trauma
    - usually diagnosed before age 5 or 6

  - mild hemophilia A  :: do not have spontaneous bleeding episodes;
    - without pre- and postoperative treatment, abnormal bleeding occurs with surgery
	    or tooth extractions
    - often not diagnosed until later in life
** Diagnostic Testing
- low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal,
  functional von Willebrand factor level
- a hemizygous F8 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
  diagnosis.
- a heterozygous F8 pathogenic variant in a symptomatic female
  confirms the diagnosis.
** Genetic Counseling
- X-linked, F8
- risk to sibs of a proband depends on the carrier status of the mother.
- Carrier females have a 50% chance of transmitting the F8 pathogenic
  variant in each pregnancy:
  - sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected
  - daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are carriers.
- Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their
  daughters and none of their sons.
- Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for
  pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the F8 pathogenic
  variant has been identified or if informative intragenic linked
  markers have been identified.
* Hemophilia B
** Clinical Characteristics
   - deficiency in factor IX clotting
   - same as Hemophilia A (section [[Hemophilia A]])
** Diagnostic Testing
- low factor IX clotting activity
- hemizygous F9 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
  diagnosis.
- heterozygous F9 pathogenic variant on in a symptomatic female
  confirms the diagnosis.
** Genetic Counseling
- X-linked, F9
- same as Hemophilia A (section [[Hemophilia A]])
* Hemochromatosis
** Clinical Characteristics
- inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal
  mucosa.

- The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes:

  - Clinical HFE hemochromatosis :: manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present
    - excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland.
    - early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis
  - Biochemical HFE hemochromatosis :: \uparrow transferrin-iron saturation, and the only evidence of iron overload is \uparrow serum ferritin
  - Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes :: neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present

** Diagnostic Testing
- biallelic HFE pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing.
** Genetic Counseling
- AR, HFE
  - Risk to sibs :: when both parents of a person with hemochromatosis
                    are heterozygous for an HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant,
                    the risk to sibs of inheriting two HFE p.Cys282Tyr
                    variants is 25%.
    - Because the HFE p.Cys282Tyr heterozygote prevalence in persons
      of European origin is high (11%, or 1/9), some parents of HFE
      p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes have two abnormal HFE alleles.
    - If one parent is heterozygous and the other parent homozygous
      for two abnormal HFE alleles, the risk to each sib of inheriting
      two HFE pathogenic alleles is 50%.
  - Risk to offspring :: Offspring of an individual with HFE
       hemochromatosis inherit one HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant from the
       parent with HFE hemochromatosis.
    - Because the chance that the other parent is a heterozygote for
      HFE p.Cys282Tyr is 1/9, the risk that the offspring will inherit
      two HFE p.Cys282Tyr variants is approximately 5%.
  - Prenatal testing ::  not usually performed because HFE
       hemochromatosis is an adult-onset, treatable disorder with low
       clinical penetrance.
