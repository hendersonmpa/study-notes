* Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy
** Clinical Characteristics
- the dystrophinopathies cover a spectrum of X-linked muscle disease
  ranging from mild to severe that includes Duchenne muscular
  dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and DMD-associated
  dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- mild end of the spectrum includes the phenotypes of asymptomatic
  increase in CK, muscle cramps with myoglobinuria
- severe end of the spectrum includes progressive muscle diseases that
  are classified as Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy when skeletal
  muscle is primarily affected and as DMD-associated dilated
  cardiomyopathy (DCM) when the heart is primarily affected

*** DMD
- usually presents in early childhood with delayed motor milestones
  including delays in walking independently and standing up from a
  supine position
- proximal weakness causes a waddling gait and difficulty climbing
  stairs, running, jumping, and standing up from a squatting
  position
- rapidly progressive, with affected children being
  wheelchair dependent by age 12 years
- few survive beyond the third decade, with respiratory complications and
  progressive cardiomyopathy being common causes of death

*** BMD
- characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness
- heart failure is a common cause of morbidity and the most common
  cause of death in BMD
- mean age of death in mid-40s
*** DCM
- characterized by left ventricular dilation and congestive heart
  failure
- females heterozygous for a DMD pathogenic variant are at increased
  risk for DCM
** Diagnostic Testing
- \Uparrow CK
- DMD molecular
  - \male{} with hemizygous pathogenic variant 
  - \female{} with heterozygous pathogenic variant
** Genetic Counselling
- X-linked DMD
- daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are heterozygous and
  may have a range of clinical manifestations
* Osteogenesis Imperfecta
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by fractures with minimal or absent trauma, variable
  dentinogenesis imperfecta
- four types
  - classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae
  - perinatally lethal OI
  - progressively deforming OI
  - common variable OI with normal sclerae

** Diagnostic Testing
- identification of a heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic
  variant in COL1A1 or COL1A2
** Genetic Counselling
- AD COL1A1 COL1A2
* Long QT Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- cardiac electrophysiologic disorder, characterized by QT
  prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that are associated
  with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade
  de pointes (TdP)
- TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the
  most common symptom in individuals with LQTS
- such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional
  stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning
- in some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and
  causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated)
  or sudden death
- approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant
  in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one
  to a few syncopal events
- cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are
  most common from the preteen years through the 20s
** Diagnostic Testing
- established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of
  specific conditions known to lengthen it
- diagnostic variants in one or more of the 15 genes known to be
  associated with LQTS
  - KCNH2 (LQT2), KCNQ1 (LQT1), and SCN5A (LQT3) are the most common

- ~ 50% have plexiform neurofibromas, but most are internal and not suspected clinically
- learning disabilities in ~ 50%

** Diagnostic Testing
- heterozygous pathogenic variants in NF1 are responsible for neurofibromatosis 1

- 50% due to /de novo/ NF2 pathogenic variant
- mosaic also possible
* Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- a congenital multiple-anomaly/cognitive impairment syndrome caused
  by an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism resulting from
  deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase
- characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth restriction,
  microcephaly, moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, and
  multiple major and minor malformations
- distinctive facial features, cleft palate, cardiac defects,
  underdeveloped external genitalia in males, postaxial polydactyly,
  and 2-3 syndactyly of the toes
- wide clinical spectrum
** Diagnostic Testing
- suggestive clinical features
- elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol level
- identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in DHCR7
- serum concentration of cholesterol is usually low
  - it may be in the normal range in approximately 10% of affected
    individuals \therefore unreliable for screening and diagnosis
** Genetic Counselling
- AR DHCR7
* Noonan Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- lentigines, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, short stature, pectus
  deformity, and dysmorphic facial features, including widely spaced
  eyes and ptosis
- multiple lentigines present as dispersed flat, black-brown macules,
  mostly on the face, neck and upper part of the trunk
  - do not appear until age four to five years but then increase to
    the thousands by puberty
** Diagnostic Testing
- clinical findings or, if clinical findings are insufficient, by
  identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of four
  genes
  - PTPN11, RAF1, BRAF, and MAP2K1
** Genetic Counselling

  C (APC) and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE)
- DVT is the most common VTE, with the legs being the most common
  site
** Diagnostic Testing
- a history of first and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE)
  manifest as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE),
  especially in women with a history of VTE during pregnancy or in
  association with use of estrogen-containing contraceptives
- a family history of recurrent thrombosis

- identification of a heterozygous or homozygous c.1691G>A variant in F5
  (the factor V Leiden variant)
  - in conjunction with coagulation tests

* G6PD Deficiency
** Clinical Characteristics
- hemolytic anemia
  - results in paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the
    eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a
    rapid heart rate
- G6PD converts glucose-6-phosphate into
  6-phosphoglucono-\delta-lactone and is the rate-limiting enzyme of
  the PP pathway that supplies reducing energy to cells by maintaining
  the level NADPH
  - NADPH maintains the supply of reduced glutathione in RBCs
** Diagnostic Testing
- CBC, Heinz bodies on film
- \uparrow LDH in hemolysis
- \downarrow haptoglobin
- Beutler spot test
** Genetic Counselling
- X-linked G6PD

* Sickle Cell Disease
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by intermittent vaso-occlusive events and chronic
  hemolytic anemia
- vaso-occlusive events result in tissue ischemia leading to acute and
  chronic pain as well as organ damage that can affect any organ
  system, including the bones, spleen, liver, brain, lungs, kidneys,
  and joints
- dactylitis (pain and/or swelling of the hands or feet) is often the
  earliest manifestation
** Diagnostic Testing
- encompasses a group of disorders characterized by the presence of at
  least one hemoglobin S allele (HbS; p.Glu6Val in HBB) and a second
  HBB pathogenic variant resulting in abnormal hemoglobin
  polymerization
- Hb S/S accounts for 60-70% of SCD in the United States
- other forms of SCD result from coinheritance of HbS with other
  abnormal \beta-globin chain variants
  - the most common forms being
    - sickle-hemoglobin C disease (Hb S/C)
    - two types of sickle \beta-thalassemia
      - Hb S/\beta^{+}-thalassemia
      - Hb S/\beta^0-thalassemia
  - rarer forms result from coinheritance of other Hb variants such as
    D-Punjab, O-Arab, and E
** Genetic Counselling
- AR HBB
* \alpha-Thalassemia
** Clinical Characteristics
- two clinically significant forms:
  - hemoglobin Bart hydrops fetalis (Hb Bart) syndrome, caused by
    deletion of all four \alpha-globin genes
    - characterized by fetal onset of generalized edema, pleural and
      pericardial effusions, and severe hypochromic anemia, in the
      absence of ABO or Rh blood group incompatibility
    - additional clinical features include marked hepatosplenomegaly,
      extramedullary erythropoiesis, hydrocephalus, and cardiac and
      urogenital defects
    - death usually occurs in the neonatal period
  - hemoglobin H (HbH) disease, most frequently caused by deletion of
    three \alpha-globin genes 
    - characterized by microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia,
      splenomegaly, mild jaundice, and sometimes thalassemia-like bone
      changes
    - individuals with HbH disease may develop gallstones and
      experience acute episodes of hemolysis in response to oxidant
      drugs and infections
** Diagnostic Testing
- diagnosis of Hb Bart syndrome is established in a fetus with the
  characteristic radiographic and laboratory features
  - identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HBA1 and HBA2
    that result in deletion or inactivation of all four \alpha-globin
    alleles confirms the diagnosis
- diagnosis of HbH disease is established in a proband with the
  characteristic laboratory and clinical features
  - identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HBA1 and HBA2
    that result in deletion or inactivation of three \alpha-globin
    alleles confirms the diagnosis
** Genetic Counselling
- AR HBA1 HBA2

|---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| Hb Bart                   | loss of 4 \alpha-globin genes                       |
| HbH disease               | loss of 3 \alpha-globin genes                       |

|                           | in cis (--/\alpha\alpha)                            |
|                           | in trans (-\alpha /-\alpha)                         |
| \alpha-thalassemia silent | loss of 1 \alpha-globin gene (-\alpha/\alpha\alpha) |

* \beta-Thalassemia
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by reduced synthesis of the hemoglobin beta chain that
  results in microcytic hypochromic anemia, an abnormal peripheral
  blood smear with nucleated red blood cells, and reduced amounts of
  hemoglobin A (HbA) on hemoglobin analysis
- individuals with thalassemia major have severe anemia and
  hepatosplenomegaly
- usually come to medical attention within the first two years of
  life
- without treatment, affected children have severe failure to thrive
  and shortened life expectancy
- treatment with a regular transfusion program and chelation therapy,
  aimed at reducing transfusion iron overload, allows for normal
  growth and development and may improve the overall prognosis
** Diagnostic Testing
- RBC indices that reveal microcytic hypochromic anemia, nucleated red
  blood cells on peripheral blood smear
- hemoglobin analysis that reveals decreased amounts of HbA and
  increased amounts HbF after age 12 months
- clinical severity of anemia
- identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HBB
** Genetic Counselling
- AR HBB
  - carrier = thalassemia minor
* Hemophilia A
** Clinical Characteristics
- deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in
  prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and
  delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing

- age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to
  the level of factor VIII clotting activity

  - severe hemophilia A ::  2 - 5 spontaneous bleeding episodes each month
    - are usually diagnosed during the first 2 years of life following
      bleeding from minor injuries
    - spontaneous joint bleeds or deep-muscle hematomas,
    - prolonged bleeding or excessive pain and swelling from minor
      injuries, surgery, and tooth extractions

  - moderate hemophilia A :: seldom have spontaneous bleeding
    - prolonged or delayed oozing after relatively minor trauma
    - usually diagnosed before age 5 or 6

  - mild hemophilia A  :: do not have spontaneous bleeding episodes;
    - without pre- and postoperative treatment, abnormal bleeding occurs with surgery
	    or tooth extractions
    - often not diagnosed until later in life
** Diagnostic Testing
- low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal,
  functional von Willebrand factor level
- a hemizygous F8 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
  diagnosis
- a heterozygous F8 pathogenic variant in a symptomatic female
  confirms the diagnosis
** Genetic Counselling
- X-linked F8

* Hemophilia B
** Clinical Characteristics
   - deficiency in factor IX clotting
   - same as Hemophilia A (Section [[Hemophilia A]])
** Diagnostic Testing
- low factor IX clotting activity
- hemizygous F9 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
  diagnosis.
- heterozygous F9 pathogenic variant on in a symptomatic female
  confirms the diagnosis.
** Genetic Counselling
- X-linked, F9

* Hemochromatosis
** Clinical Characteristics
- inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal
  mucosa

- phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes:

  - Clinical HFE hemochromatosis :: manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present
    - excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland
    - early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis
  - Biochemical HFE hemochromatosis :: \uparrow transferrin-iron saturation, and the only evidence of iron overload is \uparrow serum ferritin
  - Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes :: neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present

** Diagnostic Testing
- biallelic HFE pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing
  - p.Cys282Tyr heterozygote prevalence in persons of European origin
    is high (1/9)
- \Uparrow transferrin saturation initially 
- followed by \Uparrow serum ferritin
  - reflects increasing iron overload
** Genetic Counselling
- AR HFE
- Prenatal testing not usually performed because HFE hemochromatosis
  is an adult-onset, treatable disorder with low clinical
  penetrance

* SRY translocation
- Nonsyndromic 46,XX Testicular Disorders of Sex Development
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by the presence of a 46,XX karyotype
  - male external genitalia ranging from normal to ambiguous
  - two testicles
  - azoospermia
  - absence of müllerian structures
- \sim 85% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD
  present after puberty with normal pubic hair and normal penile size
  but small testes, gynecomastia, and sterility resulting from
  azoospermia
- \sim 15% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD
  present at birth with ambiguous genitalia
- gender role and gender identity are reported as \male
- untreated \males with 46,XX testicular DSD experience the
  consequences of testosterone deficiency
** Diagnostic Testing
- clinical findings, endocrine testing, and cytogenetic testing
- endocrine studies usually show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
  secondary to testicular failure
- cytogenetic studies at the 550-band level demonstrate a 46,XX
  karyotype
- SRY, the gene that encodes the sex-determining region Y protein, is
  the principal gene known to be associated with 46,XX testicular
  DSD
- \sim 80% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD are
  SRY positive as shown by use of FISH or chromosomal microarray (CMA)
- rearrangements in or around SOX9 and SOX3 detected by CMA, or rarely
  karyotype, have recently been reported in a few cases
  - at least one more unknown gene at another locus is implicated
** Genetic Counselling
- SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is generally not inherited because
  it results from /de novo/ abnormal interchange between the Y
  chromosome and the X chromosome, resulting in the presence of SRY on
  the X chromosome and infertility
* Turner Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- 45,X, \female{} is partly or completely missing an X chromosome
- signs and symptoms vary, often a short and webbed neck, low-set
  ears, low hairline at the back of the neck, short stature, and
  swollen hands and feet are seen at birth.
- develop menstrual periods and breasts only with hormone treatment,
  and are unable to have children without reproductive technology
- heart defects, diabetes, and low thyroid hormone occur more
  frequently
- most people with TS have normal intelligence
- vision and hearing problems occur more often
** Diagnostic Testing
- amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling
- abnormal ultrasound findings (i.e., heart defect, kidney
  abnormality, cystic hygroma, ascites)
- \uparrow risk of Turner syndrome may also be indicated by abnormal
  triple or quadruple maternal serum screen
- later diagnosis is via karyotype
** Genetic Counselling
- functional X usually from mother
- usually sporadic
- exceptions:
  - presence of a balanced translocation of the X chromosome in a parent
  - mother has 45,X mosaicism restricted to her germ cells
* Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by evidence of feminization of the external genitalia
  at birth, abnormal secondary sexual development in puberty, and
  infertility in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype
- spectrum of defects in androgen action with three broad phenotypes:
  - complete androgen insensitivity syndrome with typical
    female external genitalia
  - partial androgen insensitivity syndrome with predominantly
    female, predominantly male, or ambiguous external genitalia
  - mild androgen insensitivity syndrome with typical male external
    genitalia
** Diagnostic Testing
- established in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype who has:
  - undermasculinization of the external genitalia
  - impaired spermatogenesis with otherwise normal testes
  - absent or rudimentary müllerian structures
  - evidence of normal or increased synthesis of testosterone and its
    normal conversion to dihydrotestosterone
  - normal or increased luteinizing hormone (LH) production by the
    pituitary gland
  - and/or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in AR 
** Genetic Counselling
- X-linked
- affected 46,XY individuals are almost always infertile
* 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency
** Clinical Characteristics
- most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
  - a family of autosomal recessive disorders involving impaired
    synthesis of cortisol from cholesterol by the adrenal cortex
- excessive adrenal androgen biosynthesis results in virilization in
  all individuals and salt wasting in some individuals
  - classic form :: severe enzyme deficiency and prenatal onset of virilization
    - salt-wasting form :: aldosterone  production is inadequate \ge 75% of classic
    - simple virilizing form :: \sim 25% of classic
  - non-classic form :: mild enzyme deficiency and postnatal onset
- newborns with salt-wasting 21-OHD CAH are at risk for
  life-threatening salt-wasting crises
- individuals with the non-classic form of 21-OHD CAH present
  postnatally with signs of hyperandrogenism
- \female with the non-classic form are not virilized at birth
** Diagnostic Testing
- classic 21-OHD CAH is established in newborns with characteristic clinical features
  - \uparrow serum 17-OHP
  - \uparrow adrenal androgens
- non-classic 21-OHD is established by comparison of baseline serum
  17-OHP and ACTH-stimulated serum 17-OHP or early morning elevated
  17-OHP
- identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CYP21A2 confirms
  the clinical diagnosis and allows for family studies
** Genetic Counselling
- AR CYP21A2
