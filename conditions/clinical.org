* TODO Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy
* TODO Osteogenesis Imperfecta
* TODO Long QT syndrome
* TODO Marfan syndrome
* Neurofibromatosis type I
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by multiple caf√© au lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, iris Lisch nodules, and choroidal freckling
- ~ 50% have plexiform neurofibromas, but most are internal and not suspected clinically
- learning disabilities in ~ 50%
- Less common manifestations include optic nerve and other central
  nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors,
  scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and vasculopathy
** Diagnostic Testing
- usually based on clinical findings
- heterozygous pathogenic variants in NF1 are responsible for neurofibromatosis 1
- molecular genetic testing of NF1 is rarely needed for diagnosis
** Genetic Counseling
- AD, NF1
- 50% due to /de novo/ NF1 pathogenic variant
* Neurofibromatosis type II
** Clinical Characteristics
- bilateral vestibular schwannomas with associated symptoms of tinnitus, hearing loss, and balance dysfunction
- average age of onset is 18 to 24 years
- almost all affected individuals develop bilateral vestibular
  schwannomas by age 30 years
- NF2 is considered an adult-onset disease
** Diagnostic Testing
-  consensus diagnostic criteria and/or by identification of a
  heterozygous pathogenic variant in NF2 on molecular genetic testing

** Genetic Counseling
- AD, NF2
- 50% with affected parent
- 50% due to /de novo/ NF2 pathogenic variant
- mosaic also possible
* TODO Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome
* TODO Noonan syndrome
* TODO Charge syndrome
* TODO FGFR-related disorders (Craniosynostosis...)
* TODO Factor V Leiden thrombophilia
* TODO G6PD deficiency
* TODO Hemoglobinopathies (Sickle cell anemia, Alpha / Beta Thalassemia)
* Hemophilia A
** Clinical Characteristics
- deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in
  prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and
  delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing.

- age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to
  the level of factor VIII clotting activity.

  - severe hemophilia A ::  2 - 5 spontaneous bleeding episodes each month
    - are usually diagnosed during the first 2 years of life following
      bleeding from minor injuries.
    - spontaneous joint bleeds or deep-muscle hematomas,
    - prolonged bleeding or excessive pain and swelling from minor
      injuries, surgery, and tooth extractions.

  - moderate hemophilia A :: seldom have spontaneous bleeding;
    - prolonged or delayed oozing after relatively minor trauma
    - usually diagnosed before age 5 or 6

  - mild hemophilia A  :: do not have spontaneous bleeding episodes;
    - without pre- and postoperative treatment, abnormal bleeding occurs with surgery
	    or tooth extractions
    - often not diagnosed until later in life
** Diagnostic Testing
- low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal,
  functional von Willebrand factor level
- a hemizygous F8 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
  diagnosis.
- a heterozygous F8 pathogenic variant in a symptomatic female
  confirms the diagnosis.
** Genetic Counseling
- X-linked, F8
- risk to sibs of a proband depends on the carrier status of the mother.
- Carrier females have a 50% chance of transmitting the F8 pathogenic
  variant in each pregnancy:
  - sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected
  - daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are carriers.
- Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their
  daughters and none of their sons.
- Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for
  pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the F8 pathogenic
  variant has been identified or if informative intragenic linked
  markers have been identified.
* Hemophilia B
** Clinical Characteristics
   - deficiency in factor IX clotting
   - same as Hemophilia A (section [[Hemophilia A]])
** Diagnostic Testing
- low factor IX clotting activity
- hemizygous F9 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
  diagnosis.
- heterozygous F9 pathogenic variant on in a symptomatic female
  confirms the diagnosis.
** Genetic Counseling
- X-linked, F9
- same as Hemophilia A (section [[Hemophilia A]])
* Hemochromatosis
** Clinical Characteristics
- inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal
  mucosa.

- The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes:

  - Clinical HFE hemochromatosis :: manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present
    - excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland.
    - early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis
  - Biochemical HFE hemochromatosis :: \uparrow transferrin-iron saturation, and the only evidence of iron overload is \uparrow serum ferritin
  - Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes :: neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present

** Diagnostic Testing
- biallelic HFE pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing.
** Genetic Counseling
- AR, HFE
  - Risk to sibs :: when both parents of a person with hemochromatosis
                    are heterozygous for an HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant,
                    the risk to sibs of inheriting two HFE p.Cys282Tyr
                    variants is 25%.
    - Because the HFE p.Cys282Tyr heterozygote prevalence in persons
      of European origin is high (11%, or 1/9), some parents of HFE
      p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes have two abnormal HFE alleles.
    - If one parent is heterozygous and the other parent homozygous
      for two abnormal HFE alleles, the risk to each sib of inheriting
      two HFE pathogenic alleles is 50%.
  - Risk to offspring :: Offspring of an individual with HFE
       hemochromatosis inherit one HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant from the
       parent with HFE hemochromatosis.
    - Because the chance that the other parent is a heterozygote for
      HFE p.Cys282Tyr is 1/9, the risk that the offspring will inherit
      two HFE p.Cys282Tyr variants is approximately 5%.
  - Prenatal testing ::  not usually performed because HFE
       hemochromatosis is an adult-onset, treatable disorder with low
       clinical penetrance.
