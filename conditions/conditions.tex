\section{Cancer Genetics}
\label{sec:orged64301}
\subsection{Tuberous sclerosis}
\label{sec:org89b6cf6}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org84e926d}
\begin{itemize}
\item TSC involves abnormalities of the:
\begin{description}
\item[{skin}] hypomelanotic macules, confetti skin lesions, facial
angiofibromas, shagreen patches, fibrous cephalic plaques,
ungual fibromas
\item[{brain}] subependymal nodules, cortical dysplasias, and
subependymal giant cell astrocytomas [SEGAs], seizures,
intellectual disability / developmental delay,
psychiatric illness
\item[{kidney}] angiomyolipomas, cysts, renal cell carcinomas
\item[{heart}] rhabdomyomas, arrhythmias
\item[{lungs}] lymphangioleiomyomatosis [LAM], multifocal micronodular
pneumonocyte hyperplasia.
\end{description}
\item CNS tumors are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
\item renal disease is the second leading cause of early death.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:org6f8ce29}
\begin{itemize}
\item TSC is established in a proband with one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two major clinical features
\item One major clinical feature and two or more minor features
\item Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TSC1 or
TSC2 by molecular genetic testing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgb176228}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD
\item Two thirds of affected individuals have TSC as the result of a \emph{de novo} pathogenic variant.
\item The offspring of an affected individual are at a 50\% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant.
\item If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family
member, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk and
preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org6d8a427}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tuberin (TSC1) and hamartin (TSC2) are key regulators of the
AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and to participate in several other
signaling pathways including the MAPK, AMPK, b-catenin, calmodulin,
CDK, autophagy, and cell cycle pathways
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hereditary breast cancer}
\label{sec:org87900dc}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org6eb7a9b}
\begin{itemize}
\item BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
syndrome (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and
male:
\begin{itemize}
\item breast cancer
\item ovarian cancer (includes fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers)
\item to a lesser extent other cancers: prostate cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2
pathogenic variant
\end{itemize}
\item The exact cancer risks differ slightly depending on whether HBOC is
caused by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgc7ef9ae}
\begin{itemize}
\item The diagnosis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 HBOC is established in a proband by
identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in
BRCA1 or BRCA2 on molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org546e156}
\begin{itemize}
\item Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are inherited in an
autosomal dominant manner
\item The vast majority of individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic
variant have inherited it from a parent
\item Because of incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer
development, cancer risk reduction resulting from prophylactic
surgery, or early death, not all individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2
pathogenic variant have a parent affected with cancer
\item Offspring of an individual with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline pathogenic variant have a 50\% chance of inheriting the variant
\item Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk if the cancer-predisposing variant in the family is known
\item requests for prenatal diagnosis of adult-onset diseases are uncommon and require careful genetic counseling
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:orgb75c557}
\begin{itemize}
\item BRCA1 interacts with several proteins involved in cellular pathways,
including cell-cycle progression, gene transcription regulation, DNA
damage response, and ubiquitination
\item BRCA2 appears to be involved in the DNA repair process.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)}
\label{sec:org1f36718}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org457570f}
\begin{itemize}
\item CML is a cancer of the white blood cells
\item It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and
unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the
accumulation of these cells in the blood
\item CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a
proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and
basophils) and their precursors is found
\item It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a
characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia
chromosome
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgae867d9}
\begin{itemize}
\item CML is often suspected on the basis of a complete blood count,
\begin{itemize}
\item increased granulocytes of all types, typically including mature myeloid cells.
\item Basophils and eosinophils are almost universally increased; this feature may help differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction.
\end{itemize}
\item A bone marrow biopsy is often performed as part of the evaluation for CML
\item CML is diagnosed by cytogenetics that detects the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which involves the ABL1 gene in chromosome 9 and the BCR gene in chromosome 22.
\item As a result of this translocation, the chromosome looks smaller than
its homologue chromosome, and this appearance is known as the
Philadelphia chromosome chromosomal abnormality.
\begin{itemize}
\item can be detected by routine cytogenetics
\item involved genes BCR-ABL1 can be detected by FISH, as well as by
PCR.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org1bf08bc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Chromosomal translocation where parts of two chromosomes (the 9th
and 22nd) switch places.
\item part of the BCR ("breakpoint cluster region") gene from chromosome
22 is fused with the ABL gene on chromosome 9.
\item abl carries a tyrosine kinase, \therfore the bcr-abl fusion gene
product is also a tyrosine kinase
\item The fused BCR-ABL protein interacts with the interleukin 3beta(c) receptor subunit.
\item The BCR-ABL transcript is continuously active and does not require activation by other cellular messaging proteins.
\item In turn, BCR-ABL activates a cascade of proteins that control the cell cycle, speeding up cell division.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Familial adenomatous polyposis}
\label{sec:orga41c28f}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgb1c3b45}
\begin{itemize}
\item FAP is a colon cancer predisposition syndrome in which hundreds to
thousands of adenomatous colonic polyps develop, beginning, on
average, at age 16 years (range 7-36 years).
\item By age 35 years, 95\% of individuals with FAP have polyps; without
colectomy, colon cancer is inevitable.
\item The mean age of colon cancer diagnosis in untreated individuals is
39 years (range 34-43 years).
\item Extracolonic manifestations are variably present and include:
\begin{itemize}
\item polyps of the gastric fundus and duodenum, osteomas, dental anomalies,
\item congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE)
\item soft tissue tumors, desmoid tumors, and associated cancers
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:org0114fd2}
\begin{itemize}
\item suspected in an individual with suggestive personal and/or family
history features and confirmed by identification of a heterozygous
germline pathogenic variant in APC.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org3a63440}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD
\item \textasciitilde{}75\%-80\% of individuals with an APC-associated polyposis condition
have an affected parent
\item Offspring of an affected individual are at a 50\% risk of inheriting
the pathogenic variant in APC.
\item Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible
if a pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family
member.
\end{itemize}
\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:orgf338d14}
\begin{itemize}
\item The APC protein product is a tumor suppressor.
\item APC appears to prevent accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin and
maintain normal apoptosis and may also decrease cell proliferation,
probably through its regulation of beta-catenin.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)}
\label{sec:org139db10}
\begin{itemize}
\item AKA: Lynch Syndrome
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org0221e3b}
\begin{itemize}
\item increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cancers of the
endometrium, stomach, ovary, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract,
urinary tract, brain, and skin.

\item In individuals with Lynch syndrome the following lifetime risks for
cancer are seen:
\begin{description}
\item[{CRC}] 52\%-82\% (mean age at diagnosis 44-61 years)
\item[{Endometrial cancer in females}] 25\%-60\% (mean age at diagnosis 48-62 years)
\item[{Gastric cancer}] 6\%-13\% (mean age at diagnosis 56 years)
\item[{Ovarian cancer}] 4\%-12\% (mean age at diagnosis 42.5 years; \textasciitilde{}30\% are diagnosed < age 40 years).
\end{description}

\item The risk for other Lynch syndrome-related cancers is lower, though
substantially increased over general population rates
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgcb7f422}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lynch syndrome is established in a proband by identification of a
germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or
PMS2 or an EPCAM deletion on molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgfc04aa5}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD
\item The majority of individuals diagnosed with Lynch syndrome have
inherited the condition from a parent.
\item because of incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer
development, cancer risk reduction as a result of screening or
prophylactic surgery, or early death, not all individuals with a
pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with Lynch
syndrome have a parent who had cancer.
\item Each child of an individual with Lynch syndrome has a 50\% chance of
inheriting the pathogenic variant.
\item Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if
the pathogenic variant in the family is known.
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:orgf009c9f}
\begin{itemize}
\item EPCAM 2p21	Epithelial cell adhesion molecule
\begin{itemize}
\item EPCAM is not a mismatch repair gene, recurrent germline deletions
of the 3' region result in silencing of the adjacent downstream
MSH2 by hypermethylation
\item The adjacent MSH2 allele itself is not mutated
\item Sequence analysis of EPCAM is not appropriate for diagnosis of
Lynch syndrome
\end{itemize}
\item MLH1	3p22​.2	DNA mismatch repair protein
\item MSH2	2p21-p16 DNA mismatch repair protein
\item MSH6	2p16​.3	DNA mismatch repair protein
\item PMS2	7p22​.1	Mismatch repair endonuclease
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Li-Fraumeni syndrome}
\label{sec:org7a53c69}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org36b2a10}
\begin{itemize}
\item LFS is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with the
development of the following classic tumors:
\begin{itemize}
\item soft tissue sarcoma
\item osteosarcoma
\item pre-menopausal breast cancer
\item brain tumors
\item adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)
\item leukemias.
\end{itemize}
\item In addition, a variety of other neoplasms may occur.
\item LFS-related cancers often occur in childhood or young adulthood and
survivors have an increased risk for multiple primary cancers.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgddfced1}
\begin{itemize}
\item LFS is diagnosed in individuals meeting established clinical
criteria or in those who have a germline pathogenic variant in TP53
regardless of family cancer history.
\item At least 70\% of individuals diagnosed clinically have an
identifiable germline pathogenic variant in TP53, the only gene so
far identified in which pathogenic variants are definitively
associated with LFS.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgbaf87a0}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD
\item 7-20\% \emph{de novo} germline TP53 pathogenic variant
\item Offspring of an affected individual have a 50\% chance of inheriting
the pathogenic variant.
\item Predisposition testing for at-risk family members and prenatal
testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the
heritable pathogenic variant in the family has been identified.
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org9903c07}
\begin{itemize}
\item TP53 has been called "the guardian of the genome" and its protein
plays major roles in both the regulation of cell growth and the
maintenance of homeostasis
\item The loss of this important tumor suppressor gene decreases the
likelihood that cells with genetic errors will be flagged for DNA
repair or apoptosis. These DNA-damaged cells can go on to further
proliferate, which can lead to a colony of abnormal cells and
eventually a malignant tumor.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Retinoblastoma}
\label{sec:orga8bc8d1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org4c23d9a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the developing retina that occurs in children, usually before age five years
\item Retinoblastoma develops from cells that have cancer-predisposing variants in both copies of RB1
\item Retinoblastoma may be unifocal or multifocal.
\item \(\sim\) 60\% of affected individuals have unilateral retinoblastoma with a mean age of diagnosis of 24 months
\item \(\sim\) 40\% have bilateral retinoblastoma with a mean age of diagnosis of 15 months
\item Heritable retinoblastoma is an autosomal dominant susceptibility for retinoblastoma
\item Individuals with heritable retinoblastoma are also at increased risk of developing non-ocular tumors
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:org039827b}
\begin{itemize}
\item established by examination of the fundus of the eye using indirect
ophthalmoscopy
\item Imaging studies can be used to support the diagnosis and stage the tumor
\item The diagnosis of heritable retinoblastoma is established in a
proband with:
\begin{itemize}
\item retinoblastoma or retinoma and a family history of retinoblastoma or
\item identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in RB1.
\end{itemize}

\item The following staging has been recommended for individuals with
retinoblastoma and/or risk of heritable retinoblastoma to include
"H" to describe the genetic risk for an individual to have a
germline pathogenic variant in RB1:

\begin{description}
\item[{HX}] Unknown or insufficient evidence of a constitutional
(germline) RB1 pathogenic variant

\item[{H0}] Normal RB1 alleles in blood tested with demonstrated
high-sensitivity assays

\item[{H0*}] Normal RB1 in blood with <1\% residual risk for mosaicism

\item[{H1}] Bilateral retinoblastoma, trilateral retinoblastoma
(retinoblastoma with intracranial CNS midline embryonic
tumor), family history of retinoblastoma, or RB1 pathogenic
variant identified in blood
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org989d3ca}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD
\item Individuals with heritable retinoblastoma (H1) have a heterozygous
\emph{de novo} or inherited germline RB1 pathogenic variant.
\item Offspring of H1 individuals have a 50\% chance of inheriting the
pathogenic variant.
\item Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if
the RB1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family
member.
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org229f1d0}
\begin{itemize}
\item RB1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that is
involved in cell cycle regulation (G1 to S transition)
\item The RB protein is phosphorylated by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase
(cdk) system prior to the entry into S-phase
\item On phosphorylation, the binding activity of the pocket domain is
lost, resulting in the release of cellular proteins.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\label{sec:orgc1448b3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgc1c8588}
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in
prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and
delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing.

\item age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to
the level of factor VIII clotting activity.

\begin{description}
\item[{severe hemophilia A}] 2 - 5 spontaneous bleeding episodes each month
\begin{itemize}
\item are usually diagnosed during the first 2 years of life following
bleeding from minor injuries.
\item spontaneous joint bleeds or deep-muscle hematomas,
\item prolonged bleeding or excessive pain and swelling from minor
injuries, surgery, and tooth extractions.
\end{itemize}

\item[{moderate hemophilia A}] seldom have spontaneous bleeding;
\begin{itemize}
\item prolonged or delayed oozing after relatively minor trauma
\item usually diagnosed before age 5 or 6

\begin{itemize}
\item without pre- and postoperative treatment, abnormal bleeding occurs with surgery
or tooth extractions
\item often not diagnosed until later in life
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgcf3d076}
\begin{itemize}
\item low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal,
functional von Willebrand factor level
\item a hemizygous F8 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
diagnosis.
\item a heterozygous F8 pathogenic variant in a symptomatic female
confirms the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling

\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked, F8
\item risk to sibs of a proband depends on the carrier status of the mother.
\item Carrier females have a 50\% chance of transmitting the F8 pathogenic
variant in each pregnancy:
\begin{itemize}
\item sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected
\item daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are carriers.
\end{itemize}
\item Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their
daughters and none of their sons.
\item Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the F8 pathogenic
variant has been identified or if informative intragenic linked
markers have been identified.

\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org8f73153}
\begin{itemize}
\item low factor IX clotting activity
\item hemizygous F9 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
diagnosis.
\item heterozygous F9 pathogenic variant on in a symptomatic female
confirms the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org653ea78}
\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked, F9
\item same as Hemophilia A (section \ref{sec:orgc1448b3})
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hemochromatosis}
\label{sec:org76d5fcf}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org7e10d85}
\begin{itemize}
\item inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal
mucosa.

\item The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes:

\begin{description}
\item[{Clinical HFE hemochromatosis}] manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present
\begin{itemize}
\item excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland.
\item early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis
\end{itemize}
\item[{Biochemical HFE hemochromatosis}] \(\uparrow\) transferrin-iron saturation, and the only evidence of iron overload is \(\uparrow\) serum ferritin
\item[{Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes}] neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orga349a92}
\begin{itemize}
\item biallelic HFE pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org90d1bd0}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR, HFE
\begin{description}
\item[{Risk to sibs}] when both parents of a person with hemochromatosis
are heterozygous for an HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant,
the risk to sibs of inheriting two HFE p.Cys282Tyr
variants is 25\%.
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the HFE p.Cys282Tyr heterozygote prevalence in persons
of European origin is high (11\%, or 1/9), some parents of HFE
p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes have two abnormal HFE alleles.
\item If one parent is heterozygous and the other parent homozygous
for two abnormal HFE alleles, the risk to each sib of inheriting
two HFE pathogenic alleles is 50\%.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Risk to offspring}] Offspring of an individual with HFE
hemochromatosis inherit one HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant from the
parent with HFE hemochromatosis.
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the chance that the other parent is a heterozygote for
HFE p.Cys282Tyr is 1/9, the risk that the offspring will inherit
two HFE p.Cys282Tyr variants is approximately 5\%.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Prenatal testing}] not usually performed because HFE
hemochromatosis is an adult-onset, treatable disorder with low
clinical penetrance.

\subsection{Achondroplasia}
\label{sec:org58073d3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgf8ad4b8}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most common cause of disproportionate short stature.
\item Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs,
macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal
bossing and midface retrusion.
\item In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental
motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed
\item Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although
craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in
infancy.

dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org1dfb72b}
\begin{itemize}

with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic
counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of
inheriting two dominant skeletal dysplasias.

\begin{itemize}
\item AD, HTT
\item Offspring of an individual with a pathogenic variant have a 50\% chance of inheriting the disease-causing allele.

\item Females: mild intellectual disability
\item FMR1 pathogenic variants are complex alterations involving non-classic
gene-disrupting alterations (trinucleotide repeat expansion) and
abnormal gene methylation,
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) affected individuals occasionally have an atypical presentation with an IQ above 70,
\begin{itemize}
\item the traditional  demarcation denoting intellectual disability.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Males with an FMR1 full mutation accompanied by aberrant methylation may have a characteristic appearance:
\begin{itemize}
\item large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears
\item connective tissue findings (joint laxity), and large testes after puberty.
\item Behavioral abnormalities, sometimes including autism spectrum disorder, are common.
\end{itemize}
\item fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, and FMR1-related
primary ovarian insufficiency are less severe forms due to smaller
repeats
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org65ebf5b}
\begin{itemize}
\item alteration in FMR1.
\item \textgreater{} 99\% of individuals with fragile X syndrome have:
\begin{itemize}
\item lof variant of FMR1 caused by an increased number of CGG
trinucleotide repeats (typically >200)
\item accompanied by aberrant methylation of FMR1
\end{itemize}
\item Other pathogenic variants include:
\begin{itemize}
\item deletions and single-nucleotide variants.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgdec09dc}
\begin{itemize}
\item All mothers of individuals with an FMR1 full mutation (expansion
>200 CGG trinucleotide repeats and abnormal methylation) are
carriers of an FMR1 pathogenic variant.
\item Mothers and their female relatives who are premutation carriers are
at increased risk for FXTAS and POI;
\item those with a full mutation may have findings of fragile X syndrome.
\item All are at increased risk of having offspring with fragile X syndrome, FXTAS, and POI.
\item Males with premutations are at increased risk for FXTAS.
\item Males with FXTAS will transmit their FMR1 premutation expansion to none of their sons and to all of their daughters, who will be premutation carriers.
\item Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the diagnosis of an
FMR1-related disorder has been confirmed in a family member.

\item FRDA is typically associated with dysarthria, muscle weakness,
spasticity particularly in the lower limbs, scoliosis, bladder
dysfunction, absent lower-limb reflexes, and loss of position and
vibration sense.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textasciitilde{}2/3 have cardiomyopathy
\item \textasciitilde{}30\% have diabetes mellitus,
\item \textasciitilde{}25\% have an "atypical" presentation with later onset or retained
tendon reflexes.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgb2996b5}
\begin{itemize}
\item established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic
variants in FXN.
\item An abnormally expanded GAA repeat in intron 1 of FXN observed on
both alleles in \textasciitilde{}96\% with FRDA
\item remaining are compound heterozygotes for abnormally expanded GAA
repeat in the disease-causing range on one allele and another
intragenic pathogenic variant on the other allele.
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Four classes of alleles are recognized for the GAA repeat sequence in intron 1 of FXN
\begin{description}
\item[{Normal alleles}] 5-33 GAA repeats
\item[{Mutable normal (premutation) alleles}] 34-65 GAA repeats
\item[{Borderline alleles}] 44-66 GAA repeats. The shortest repeat length associated with disease
\item[{Full-penetrance (disease-causing expanded) alleles}] 66-1,300 GAA repeats
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

Rare alleles of variant structure. In contrast to the alleles discussed above in which the GAA trinucleotides are perfect repeats, in rare pathogenic alleles the GAA repeats are not in perfect tandem order but rather are interrupted by other nucleotides. Such "interrupted FXN alleles" differ in length and types of nucleotides in the interruption, but they are typically close to the 3' end of the GAA repeat tract (see Molecular Genetics).

impairment, gait ataxia and/or tremulousness of the limbs
\item unique behavior with an inappropriate happy demeanor that includes
frequent laughing, smiling, and excitability.
\item Microcephaly and seizures are also common.

AS and PWS}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item molecular genetic testing deficient expression or function of the
maternally inherited UBE3A allele.
\item parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosome region detects approximately 80\%
\begin{itemize}
\item including deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting defect (ID)
\end{itemize}
\item \textless{} 1\% have a cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangement (i.e., translocation or inversion).
\item UBE3A sequence analysis detects pathogenic variants \textasciitilde{}11\% of individuals.
\item molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence
analysis) \textasciitilde{}90\% of individuals.
\item Remaining 10\% with classic phenotypic features of AS have the
disorder as a result of an as-yet unidentified genetic mechanism
\begin{itemize}
\item not amenable to diagnostic testing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgee5a209}
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by disruption of maternally imprinted UBE3A located within
the 15q11.2-q13 Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome region.
\item The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism
leading to the loss of UBE3A function
\begin{itemize}
\item typically less than 1\% risk for probands with a deletion or UPD
\item as high as 50\% for probands with an ID or a pathogenic variant of UBE3A.
\end{itemize}
\item Members of the mother's extended family are also at increased risk
when an ID or a UBE3A pathogenic variant is present.
\item Cytogepnetically visible chromosome rearrangements may be inherited,usually \emph{de novo}.
\item Prenatal testing is possible when the underlying genetic mechanism
is a deletion, UPD, an ID, a UBE3A pathogenic variant, or a
chromosome rearrangement.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome}
\label{sec:org8207a70}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org827cddf}
\begin{itemize}
\item growth disorder variably characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia,
macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, omphalocele, embryonal
tumors (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and
rhabdomyosarcoma), visceromegaly, adrenocortical cytomegaly, renal
abnormalities (e.g., medullary dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis,
medullary sponge kidney, and nephromegaly), and ear creases/pits.

\item a clinical spectrum, may have many of these features or only one or two.

\item Early death may occur from complications of prematurity,
hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, or tumors.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orge82bafb}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cytogenetically detectable abnormalities involving chromosome 11p15
are found in 1\% or fewer of affected individuals.

\item Molecular genetic testing can identify epigenetic and genomic
alterations of chromosome 11p15 in individuals with BWS:
\begin{itemize}
\item Loss of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
center 2 (IC2) in 50\% of affected individuals;
\item Paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 11p15 in 20\%
\item Gain of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
center 1 (IC1) in 5\%.
\end{itemize}
\item Methylation alterations associated with deletions or duplications in
this region have high heritability.

\item Sequence analysis of CDKN1C identifies a heterozygous maternally
inherited pathogenic variant in approximately 40\% of familial cases
and 5\%-10\% of cases with no family history of BWS.
\end{itemize}

BWS Chromosome 11}
\end{figure}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgb8230bf}
\begin{itemize}
\item associated with abnormal regulation of gene transcription in two
imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15.5.
\item Most individuals with BWS are reported to have normal chromosome
studies or karyotypes.
\item \textasciitilde{}85\% of individuals with BWS have no family history of BWS
\item \textasciitilde{}15\% have a family history consistent with parent-of-origin
autosomal dominant transmission.
\item Children of subfertile parents conceived by assisted reproductive
technology (ART) may be at increased risk for imprinting disorders,
including BWS.
\item Identification of the underlying genetic mechanism causing BWS
permits better estimation of recurrence risk.
\item Prenatal screening for pregnancies in the general population that
identifies findings suggestive of a diagnosis of BWS may lead to the
consideration of
\begin{itemize}
\item chromosome analysis, chromosomal microarray, and/or molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\item prenatal testing by chromosome analysis for families with an
inherited chromosome abnormality or by molecular genetic testing for
families in which the molecular mechanism of BWS has been defined
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Prader-Willi syndrome}
\label{sec:org9901d18}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org42726a1}
\begin{itemize}
\item severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in early infancy
\item later infancy or early childhood by excessive eating
\item gradual development of morbid obesity
\item Motor milestones and language development are delayed.
\item All individuals have some degree of cognitive impairment.
\item A distinctive behavioral phenotype (with temper tantrums, stubbornness, manipulative behavior, and obsessive-compulsive characteristics) is common.
\item Hypogonadism is present in both males and females and manifests as genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most, infertility.
\item Short stature is common (if not treated with growth hormone);
\item characteristic facial features, strabismus, and scoliosis are often present.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org9b6c84b}
\begin{itemize}
\item DNA methylation testing to detect abnormal parent-specific
imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) on
chromosome 15
\item testing determines whether the region is maternally inherited only
\begin{itemize}
\item the paternally contributed region is absent
\item detects more than 99\% of affected individuals
\item DNA methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the
diagnosis of PWS in all individuals,
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgb0ca85d}
\begin{itemize}
\item PWS is caused by an absence of expression of imprinted genes in the
paternally derived PWS/Angelman syndrome (AS) region (15q11.2-q13)
of chromosome 15:
\begin{itemize}
\item paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15 and rarely an imprinting defect.
\end{itemize}
\item The risk to the sibs depends on the genetic mechanism.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textless{} 1\% if the affected child has a deletion or uniparental disomy
\item up to 50\% if the affected child has an imprinting defect
\item up to 25\% if a parental chromosome translocation is present
\end{itemize}
\item Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk if
the underlying genetic mechanism is known.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Russell-Silver syndrome}
\label{sec:org6e3e574}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orga3324cc}
\begin{itemize}
\item asymmetric gestational growth restriction resulting in affected
individuals being born small for gestational age, with relative
macrocephaly at birth (head circumference \(\le\)1.5 SD above birth
weight and/or length), prominent forehead usually with frontal
bossing, and frequently body asymmetry.
\item This is followed by postnatal growth failure, and in some cases progressive limb length discrepancy and feeding difficulties.
\item Additional clinical features include triangular facies, fifth-finger clinodactyly, and micrognathia with narrow chin.
\item The average adult height in untreated individuals is \textasciitilde{}3.1\textpm{}1.4 SD below the mean.
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org738cb64}
\begin{itemize}
\item a genetically heterogeneous condition.
\item Genetic testing confirms clinical diagnosis in approximately 60\% of
affected individuals.
\begin{itemize}
\item hypomethylation of the imprinted control region 1 (ICR1) at
11p15.5 causes SRS in 35\%-50\% of individuals
\item maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD7) causes SRS in 7\%-10\% of individuals.
\item a small number of individuals with SRS who have duplications,
deletions or translocations involving the imprinting centers at
11p15.5 or duplications, deletions, or translocations involving
chromosome 7.
\item rarely, affected individuals with pathogenic variants in CDKN1C,
IGF2, PLAG1, and HMGA2 have been described.
\item approximately 40\% of individuals who meet NH-CSS clinical criteria
for SRS have negative molecular and/or cytogenetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

11p Duplication in RSS}
\end{figure}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgbc7591f}
\begin{itemize}
\item SRS has multiple etiologies and typically has a low recurrence
risk.
\item In most families, a proband with SRS represents a simplex case (a single affected family member) and has
SRS as the result of an apparent \emph{de novo} epigenetic or genetic alteration
\begin{itemize}
\item loss of paternal methylation at the 11p15 ICR1 H19/IGF2 imprinting center 1 or
\item maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 7.
\end{itemize}
\item SRS may also occur as the result of a genetic alteration associated with up to a 50\% recurrence risk
\begin{itemize}
\item copy number variant on chromosome 7 or 11 or
\item an intragenic pathogenic  variant in CDKN1C, IGF2, PLAG2, or HMGA2
\end{itemize}
\item Accurate assessment of SRS recurrence therefore requires
identification of the causative genetic mechanism in the proband.
