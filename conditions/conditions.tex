\section{Cancer Genetics}
\label{sec:org6510d46}
\subsection{Tuberous Sclerosis}
\label{sec:orgea0665a}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org8291ab3}
\begin{itemize}
\item TSC involves abnormalities of the:
\begin{description}
\item[{skin}] hypomelanotic macules, confetti skin lesions, facial
angiofibromas, shagreen patches, fibrous cephalic plaques,
ungual fibromas
\item[{brain}] subependymal nodules, cortical dysplasias, and
subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), seizures,
intellectual disability / developmental delay,
psychiatric illness
\item[{kidney}] angiomyolipomas, cysts, renal cell carcinomas
\item[{heart}] rhabdomyomas, arrhythmias
\item[{lungs}] lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), multifocal micronodular
pneumonocyte hyperplasia.
\end{description}
\item CNS tumors are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
\item renal disease is the second leading cause of early death.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgdeb826c}
\begin{itemize}
\item TSC is established in a proband with one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item two major clinical features
\item one major clinical feature and two or more minor features
\item identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TSC1 or
TSC2 by molecular genetic testing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:org2d49b14}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD TSC1 TSC2
\item two thirds of affected individuals have TSC as the result of a \emph{de novo} pathogenic variant
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:orgf20225c}
\begin{itemize}
\item tuberin (TSC1) and hamartin (TSC2) are key regulators of the
AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and to participate in several other
signaling pathways including the MAPK, AMPK, b-catenin, calmodulin,
CDK, autophagy, and cell cycle pathways
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hereditary Breast \& Ovarian Cancer}
\label{sec:orgd99686c}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org8d5f4be}
\begin{itemize}
\item BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
syndrome (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and
male:
\begin{itemize}
\item breast cancer
\item ovarian cancer includes fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers
\item to a lesser extent other cancers: prostate cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2
pathogenic variant
\end{itemize}
\item the exact cancer risks differ slightly depending on whether HBOC is
caused by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:org8d64ee2}
\begin{itemize}
\item diagnosis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 HBOC is established in a proband by
identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in
BRCA1 or BRCA2 on molecular genetic testing
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:org7c1a734}
\begin{itemize}
\item germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are inherited in an
\textbf{autosomal dominant} manner
\item majority of individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant
have inherited it from a parent
\item \(\because\) incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer development,
cancer risk reduction resulting from prophylactic surgery, or early
death, not all individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant
have a parent affected with cancer
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org4c866b8}
\begin{itemize}
\item BRCA1 interacts with several proteins involved in cellular pathways,
including cell-cycle progression, gene transcription regulation, DNA
damage response, and ubiquitination
\item BRCA2 appears to be involved in the DNA repair process
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)}
\label{sec:orge3a2363}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org4ba3219}
\begin{itemize}
\item CML is a cancer of the white blood cells
\item a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated
growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of
these cells in the blood
\item CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a
proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and
basophils) and their precursors is found
\item a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic
chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orge509b0c}
\begin{itemize}
\item CML is often suspected on the basis of a complete blood count
\begin{itemize}
\item increased granulocytes of all types, typically including mature myeloid cells
\item basophils and eosinophils are almost universally increased; this
feature may help differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction
\end{itemize}
\item bone marrow biopsy is often performed as part of the evaluation for CML
\item CML is diagnosed by cytogenetics that detects the translocation
t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which involves the ABL1 gene in chromosome 9 and
the BCR gene in chromosome 22
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\because\) of this translocation, the chromosome looks smaller than
its homologue chromosome, and is known as the Philadelphia
chromosome
\item can be detected by routine cytogenetics
\item BCR-ABL1 fusion can be detected by FISH, as well as by PCR
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org78c2d68}
\begin{itemize}
\item chromosomal translocation where parts of two chromosomes (the 9th
and 22nd) switch places
\item part of the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene from chromosome
22 is fused with the ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9
\item abl carries a tyrosine kinase, \therfore the bcr-abl fusion gene
product is also a tyrosine kinase
\item BCR-ABL transcript is continuously active and does not require
activation by other cellular messaging proteins
\begin{itemize}
\item BCR-ABL activates a cascade of proteins that control the cell
cycle, speeding up cell division
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Familial Adenomatous Polyposis}
\label{sec:org9314234}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org4601440}
\begin{itemize}
\item FAP is a colon cancer predisposition syndrome in which hundreds to
thousands of adenomatous colonic polyps develop, beginning, on
average, at age 16 years (range 7-36 years)
\item by age 35 years, 95\% of individuals with FAP have polyps
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{without colectomy colon cancer is inevitable}
\end{itemize}
\item mean age of colon cancer diagnosis in untreated individuals is
39 years (range 34-43 years)
\item extracolonic manifestations are variably present and include:
\begin{itemize}
\item polyps of the gastric fundus and duodenum, osteomas, dental anomalies,
\item congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE)
\item soft tissue tumors, desmoid tumors, and associated cancers
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:org58c6e8e}
\begin{itemize}
\item suspected in an individual with suggestive personal and/or family
history features and confirmed by identification of a heterozygous
germline pathogenic variant in APC
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:orgbcbbc2b}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD APC
\item \textasciitilde{}75\%-80\% of individuals with an APC-associated polyposis condition
have an affected parent
\end{itemize}
\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org91b310c}
\begin{itemize}
\item APC protein product is a tumor suppressor
\item APC appears to prevent accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin and
maintain normal apoptosis and may also decrease cell proliferation,
probably through its regulation of beta-catenin
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC)}
\label{sec:org2e2c74a}
\begin{itemize}
\item AKA: Lynch Syndrome
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orge07d9ad}
\begin{itemize}
\item increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cancers of the
endometrium, stomach, ovary, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract,
urinary tract, brain, and skin

\item individuals with Lynch syndrome the following lifetime risks for
cancer are seen:
\begin{description}
\item[{CRC}] 52\%-82\% (mean age at diagnosis 44-61 years)
\item[{Endometrial cancer in females}] 25\%-60\% (mean age at diagnosis 48-62 years)
\item[{Gastric cancer}] 6\%-13\% (mean age at diagnosis 56 years)
\item[{Ovarian cancer}] 4\%-12\% (mean age at diagnosis 42.5 years; \textasciitilde{}30\%
are diagnosed < age 40 years)
\end{description}

\item risk for other Lynch syndrome-related cancers is lower, though
substantially increased over general population rates
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgccf9e14}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lynch syndrome is established in a proband by identification of a
germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or
PMS2 or an EPCAM deletion on molecular genetic testing
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:orge40c985}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD MLH1 MSH2 MSH6 PMS2 EPCAM
\item majority of individuals diagnosed with Lynch syndrome have
inherited the condition from a parent
\item because of incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer
development, cancer risk reduction as a result of screening or
prophylactic surgery, or early death, not all individuals with a
pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with Lynch
syndrome have a parent who had cancer
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org75d3f8b}
\begin{description}
\item[{EPCAM 2p21}] epithelial cell adhesion molecule
\begin{itemize}
\item recurrent germline deletions of the 3' region result in silencing
of the adjacent downstream MSH2 by hypermethylation
\item the adjacent MSH2 allele itself is not mutated
\item sequence analysis of EPCAM is not appropriate for diagnosis of
Lynch syndrome
\end{itemize}
\item[{MLH1 3p22​.2}] DNA mismatch repair protein
\item[{MSH2 2p21-p16}] DNA mismatch repair protein
\item[{MSH6 2p16​.3}] DNA mismatch repair protein
\item[{PMS2 7p22​.1}] mismatch repair endonuclease
\end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Li-Fraumeni Syndrome}
\label{sec:org8840017}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org5e7cff6}
\begin{itemize}
\item LFS is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with the
development of the following classic tumors:
\begin{itemize}
\item soft tissue sarcoma
\item osteosarcoma
\item pre-menopausal breast cancer
\item brain tumors
\item adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)
\item leukemias
\end{itemize}
\item a variety of other neoplasms may occur
\item LFS-related cancers often occur in childhood or young adulthood and
survivors have an increased risk for multiple primary cancers
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgd5feb82}
\begin{itemize}
\item LFS is diagnosed in individuals meeting established clinical
criteria or in those who have a germline pathogenic variant in TP53
regardless of family cancer history
\item \(\ge\) 70\% of individuals diagnosed clinically have an identifiable
germline pathogenic variant in TP53, the only gene so far identified
in which pathogenic variants are definitively associated with LFS
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:org848b9a1}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD TP53
\item 7-20\% \emph{de novo} germline TP53 pathogenic variant
\end{itemize}

\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org1dc7cce}
\begin{itemize}
\item TP53 has been called "the guardian of the genome" and its protein
plays major roles in both the regulation of cell growth and the
maintenance of homeostasis
\item loss of this important \textbf{tumor suppressor gene} decreases the
likelihood that cells with genetic errors will be flagged for DNA
repair or apoptosis
\item DNA-damaged cells can go on to further proliferate, which can lead
to a colony of abnormal cells and eventually a malignant tumor
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Retinoblastoma}
\label{sec:org42c0a75}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org983ec33}
\begin{itemize}
\item retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the developing retina that
occurs in children, usually before age five years
\item develops from cells that have cancer-predisposing variants in both
copies of RB1
\item may be unifocal or multifocal
\item \(\sim\) 60\% of affected individuals have unilateral retinoblastoma with
a mean age of diagnosis of 24 months
\item \(\sim\) 40\% have bilateral retinoblastoma with a mean age of diagnosis
of 15 months
\item individuals with heritable retinoblastoma are also at increased risk
of developing non-ocular tumors
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnosis
\label{sec:orgddea77a}
\begin{itemize}
\item established by examination of the fundus of the eye using indirect
ophthalmoscopy
\item imaging studies can be used to support the diagnosis and stage the tumor
\item diagnosis of heritable retinoblastoma is established in a proband
with:
\begin{itemize}
\item retinoblastoma or retinoma and a family history of retinoblastoma or
\item identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in RB1
\end{itemize}

\item the following staging has been recommended for individuals with
retinoblastoma and/or risk of heritable retinoblastoma to include
"H" to describe the genetic risk for an individual to have a
germline pathogenic variant in RB1:

\begin{description}
\item[{HX}] unknown or insufficient evidence of a constitutional
(germline) RB1 pathogenic variant

\item[{H0}] normal RB1 alleles in blood tested with demonstrated
high-sensitivity assays

\item[{H0*}] normal RB1 in blood with <1\% residual risk for mosaicism

\item[{H1}] bilateral retinoblastoma, trilateral retinoblastoma
(retinoblastoma with intracranial CNS midline embryonic
tumor), family history of retinoblastoma, or RB1 pathogenic
variant identified in blood
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:orgb6f112a}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD RB1
\item individuals with heritable retinoblastoma have a heterozygous \emph{de
novo} or inherited germline RB1 pathogenic variant
\item susceptibility is AD mode of action similar to AR
\begin{itemize}
\item inheritance of a single mutant allele "first hit"
\item a somatic mutation "second hit" is required
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Pathophysiology
\label{sec:org014feea}
\begin{itemize}
\item RB1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that is
involved in cell cycle regulation (G1 to S transition)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that are associated
with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade
de pointes (TdP)
\item TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the
most common symptom in individuals with LQTS
\item such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional
stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning
\item in some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and
causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated)
or sudden death
\item approximately 50\% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant
in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one
to a few syncopal events

\item identification of the underlying genetic mechanism causing BWS
permits better estimation of recurrence risk
\item prenatal screening for pregnancies in the general population that
identifies findings suggestive of a diagnosis of BWS may lead to the
consideration of chromosome analysis, chromosomal microarray, and/or
molecular genetic testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Russell-Silver Syndrome}
\label{sec:orgc5157c7}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org4ca60ce}
\begin{itemize}
\item asymmetric gestational growth restriction resulting in affected
individuals being born small for gestational age, with relative
macrocephaly at birth,prominent forehead usually with frontal
bossing, and frequently body asymmetry
\begin{itemize}
\item followed by postnatal growth failure, and in some cases progressive
limb length discrepancy and feeding difficulties
\end{itemize}
\item additional clinical features include triangular facies, fifth-finger
clinodactyly, and micrognathia with narrow chin
\item the average adult height in untreated individuals is \textasciitilde{}3 SD below the
mean
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org11c0238}
\begin{itemize}
\item a genetically heterogeneous condition
\item genetic testing confirms clinical diagnosis in approximately 60\% of
affected individuals
\begin{itemize}
\item hypomethylation of the imprinted control region 1 (ICR1) at
11p15.5 in 35\%-50\% of individuals
\item maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD7) in 7\%-10\% of
individuals
\item a small number of individuals have duplications, deletions or
translocations involving the imprinting centers at 11p15.5 or
duplications, deletions, or translocations involving chromosome 7
\item rarely, affected individuals with pathogenic variants in CDKN1C,
IGF2, PLAG1, and HMGA2 have been described
\item approximately 40\% of individuals who meet NH-CSS clinical criteria
for RSS have negative molecular and/or cytogenetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:org080243c}
\begin{itemize}
\item multiple etiologies and typically has a low recurrence risk
\item in most families, a proband with RSS represents a simplex case (a
single affected family member) and has RSS as the result of an
apparent \emph{de novo} epigenetic or genetic alteration
\begin{itemize}
\item loss of paternal methylation at the 11p15 ICR1 H19/IGF2 imprinting center 1 or
\item maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome
\end{itemize}
\item RSS may also occur as the result of a genetic alteration associated
with up to a 50\% recurrence risk
\begin{itemize}
\item copy number variant on chromosome 7 or 11 or
\item an intragenic pathogenic variant in CDKN1C, IGF2, PLAG2, or HMGA2
\end{itemize}
\item accurate assessment of recurrence therefore requires
identification of the causative genetic mechanism in the proband
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rett Syndrome}
\label{sec:org49bcb48}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org6461367}
\begin{description}
\item[{\female{} Classic Rett syndrome}] a progressive neurodevelopmental
disorder primarily affecting girls, is characterized by apparently
normal psychomotor development during the first six to 18 months of
life, followed by a short period of developmental stagnation, then
rapid regression in language and motor skills, followed by long-term
stability
\item[{\male{} Severe neonatal-onset encephalopathy}] the most common
phenotype in affected males, is characterized by a relentless
clinical course that follows a metabolic-degenerative type of
pattern, abnormal tone, involuntary movements, severe seizures, and
breathing abnormalities. Death often occurs before age two years
\end{description}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgc865e20}
\begin{itemize}
\item diagnosis of a MECP2 disorder is established by molecular genetic
testing in a female proband with suggestive findings and a
heterozygous MECP2 pathogenic variant, and in a male proband with
suggestive findings and a hemizygous MECP2 pathogenic variant
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counselling
\label{sec:org72ff93a}
\begin{itemize}
\item XL MECP2
\item \textgreater{} 99\% are simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family),
resulting from a \emph{de novo} pathogenic variant or possibly from
inheritance of the pathogenic variant from a parent who has germline
mosaicism
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type IA}
\label{sec:org449017c}
AKA Hereditary Neuropathy with Pressure Palsies
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org360d733}
\begin{itemize}
\item characterized by repeated focal pressure neuropathies such as carpal
tunnel syndrome and peroneal palsy with foot drop
\item first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade
\item recovery from acute neuropathy is often complete
\begin{itemize}
\item when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is usually
mild
\end{itemize}
\item some affected individuals also have signs of a mild to moderate
peripheral neuropathy
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgd271ba3}
\begin{itemize}
\item diagnosis of HNPP is established in an adult with recurrent focal
compression neuropathies who has a family history consistent with
autosomal dominant inheritance
\item PMP22 is the only gene known to be associated with HNPP
\item a contiguous gene deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 that includes PMP22
is present in approximately 80\% of affected individuals
\begin{itemize}
\item the remaining 20\% have a pathogenic variant in PMP22
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:orgf1bdfff}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orge894911}
\begin{itemize}
\item characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy resulting from
progressive degeneration and irreversible loss of the anterior horn
cells in the spinal cord (i.e., lower motor neurons) and the brain
stem nuclei
\item onset of weakness ranges from before birth to adulthood
\item weakness is symmetric, proximal \textgreater{} distal, and progressive
\item used to be supportive care only now RNA therapy
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org49057f6}
\begin{itemize}
\item established in a proband with a history of motor difficulties or
regression, proximal muscle weakness, reduced/absent deep tendon
reflexes, evidence of motor unit disease
\item identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SMN1 on
molecular genetic testing
\item increases in SMN2 copy number often moderate the phenotype
