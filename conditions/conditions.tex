\subsection{Hemophilia A}
\label{sec:orge892ee0}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgbd2b5e7}
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in
prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and
delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing.

\item age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to
the level of factor VIII clotting activity.

\begin{description}
\item[{severe hemophilia A}] 2 - 5 spontaneous bleeding episodes each month
\begin{itemize}
\item are usually diagnosed during the first 2 years of life following
bleeding from minor injuries.
\item spontaneous joint bleeds or deep-muscle hematomas,
\item prolonged bleeding or excessive pain and swelling from minor
injuries, surgery, and tooth extractions.
\end{itemize}

\item[{moderate hemophilia A}] seldom have spontaneous bleeding;
\begin{itemize}
\item prolonged or delayed oozing after relatively minor trauma
\item usually diagnosed before age 5 or 6
\end{itemize}

\item[{mild hemophilia A }] do not have spontaneous bleeding episodes;
\begin{itemize}
\item without pre- and postoperative treatment, abnormal bleeding occurs with surgery
or tooth extractions
\item often not diagnosed until later in life
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org7895349}
\begin{itemize}
\item low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal,
functional von Willebrand factor level
\item a hemizygous F8 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
diagnosis.
\item a heterozygous F8 pathogenic variant in a symptomatic female
confirms the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgf23fe51}
\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked
\item risk to sibs of a proband depends on the carrier status of the mother.
\item Carrier females have a 50\% chance of transmitting the F8 pathogenic
variant in each pregnancy:
\begin{itemize}
\item sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected
\item daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are carriers.
\end{itemize}
\item Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their
daughters and none of their sons.
\item Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the F8 pathogenic
variant has been identified or if informative intragenic linked
markers have been identified.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hemophilia B}
\label{sec:orgccffc6b}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgd916c5f}
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency in factor IX clotting
\item same as Hemophilia A (section \ref{sec:orge892ee0})
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgf54b365}
\begin{itemize}
\item low factor IX clotting activity
\item hemizygous F9 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
diagnosis.
\item heterozygous F9 pathogenic variant on in a symptomatic female
confirms the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgedc6096}
\begin{itemize}
\item same as Hemophilia A (section \ref{sec:orge892ee0})
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hemochromatosis}
\label{sec:orge333ecd}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org7bb0d3e}
\begin{itemize}
\item inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal
mucosa.

\item The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes:

\begin{description}
\item[{Clinical HFE hemochromatosis}] manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present
\begin{itemize}
\item excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland.
\item early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis
\end{itemize}
\item[{Biochemical HFE hemochromatosis}] \(\uparrow\) transferrin-iron saturation, and the only evidence of iron overload is \(\uparrow\) serum ferritin
\item[{Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes}] neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orga50a38e}
\begin{itemize}
\item biallelic HFE pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgffbcd26}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR
\begin{description}
\item[{Risk to sibs}] when both parents of a person with hemochromatosis
are heterozygous for an HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant,
the risk to sibs of inheriting two HFE p.Cys282Tyr
variants is 25\%.
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the HFE p.Cys282Tyr heterozygote prevalence in persons
of European origin is high (11\%, or 1/9), some parents of HFE
p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes have two abnormal HFE alleles.
\item If one parent is heterozygous and the other parent homozygous
for two abnormal HFE alleles, the risk to each sib of inheriting
two HFE pathogenic alleles is 50\%.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Risk to offspring}] Offspring of an individual with HFE
hemochromatosis inherit one HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant from the
parent with HFE hemochromatosis.
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the chance that the other parent is a heterozygote for
HFE p.Cys282Tyr is 1/9, the risk that the offspring will inherit
two HFE p.Cys282Tyr variants is approximately 5\%.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Prenatal testing}] not usually performed because HFE
hemochromatosis is an adult-onset, treatable disorder with low
clinical penetrance.
\end{description}

\section{Molecular Genetics}
\label{sec:org87eeabe}
\subsection{Cystic fibrosis}
\label{sec:orged00cb9}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org86341c4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multisystem disease affecting epithelia of the respiratory tract, exocrine pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, and exocrine sweat glands.
\item Morbidities include progressive obstructive lung disease with bronchiectasis, frequent hospitalizations for pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency and malnutrition, recurrent sinusitis and bronchitis, and male infertility.
\item Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF.
\item Meconium ileus occurs at birth in 15\%-20\% of newborns with CF.
\item More than 95\% of males with CF are infertile.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgda66298}
\begin{itemize}
\item one or more characteristic phenotypic features and evidence of an abnormality in CFTR function
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 elevated sweat chloride values or
\item biallelic CFTR pathogenic variants or
\item transepithelial nasal potential difference measurement characteristic of CF
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnosis of CF is established in an infant with:
\begin{itemize}
\item elevated NBS IRT and
\item identification of biallelic CFTR pathogenic variants or
\item an elevated sweat chloride.
\begin{itemize}
\item quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride values (>60 mmol/L in infants age > 6 months)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgb86ea6d}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR
\item At conception, each sib of an affected individual with CF have:
\begin{itemize}
\item a 25\% chance of being affected
\item a 50\% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier
\item a 25\% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.
\end{itemize}
\item Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the CFTR pathogenic variants in the family are known.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Achondroplasia}
\label{sec:org44a7b8b}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgedac5f4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most common cause of disproportionate short stature.
\item Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs,
macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal
bossing and midface retrusion.
\item In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental
motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed
\item Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although
craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in
infancy.
\item Additional complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear
dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org29a0318}
\begin{itemize}
\item Diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in
most affected individuals.
\item In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or atypical
findings, identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in
FGFR3 can establish the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org07ff2a2}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD
\item \textasciitilde{}80\% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average
stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a \emph{de novo}
pathogenic variant.
\begin{itemize}
\item these parents have a very low risk of having another child with
achondroplasia.
\end{itemize}
\item An individual with achondroplasia who has a reproductive partner
with average stature is at 50\% risk in each pregnancy of having a
child with achondroplasia.
\item When both parents have achondroplasia the risk to their offspring of
having:
\begin{itemize}
\item average stature is 25\%
\item achondroplasia is 50\%
\item homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition) is 25\%.
\end{itemize}

\item If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are affected
with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic
counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of
inheriting two dominant skeletal dysplasias.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Huntington disease}
\label{sec:orgecb05b3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgcc351f9}
\begin{itemize}
\item a progressive disorder of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric
disturbances.
\item mean age of onset is 35 to 44 years and the median survival time is
15 to 18 years after onset.
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgb127015}
\begin{itemize}
\item diagnosis of HD rests on:
\begin{itemize}
\item positive family history
\item characteristic clinical findings
\item detection of an expansion of 36 or more CAG trinucleotide repeats in HTT.
\end{itemize}

\item All individuals with HD have an expansion in the number of CAG
trinucleotide repeats that encode glutamine amino acids in exon 1 of
HTT.
\begin{description}
\item[{Normal alleles}] 26 or fewer CAG trinucleotide repeats
\item[{Intermediate alleles}] 27-35 CAG trinucleotide repeats
\begin{itemize}
\item An individual with an allele in this range is not at risk of
developing symptoms of HD but, because of instability in the CAG
tract, may be at risk of having a child with an allele in the
HD-causing range
\end{itemize}
\item[{HD-causing alleles}] \(\ge\) 36 CAG trinucleotide repeats
\begin{itemize}
\item Persons who have an HD-causing allele are considered at risk of
developing HD in their lifetime.
\item HD-causing alleles are further classified as:
\begin{description}
\item[{Reduced-penetrance HD-causing alleles}] 36-39 CAG
\item[{Full-penetrance HD-causing alleles}] \(\ge\) 40 CAG
\end{description}
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org0246aa1}
\begin{itemize}
\item AD
\item Offspring of an individual with a pathogenic variant have a 50\% chance of inheriting the disease-causing allele.
\item Predictive testing in asymptomatic adults at risk is available but requires careful thought (including pre- and post-test genetic counseling) as there is currently no cure for the disorder.
\begin{itemize}
\item asymptomatic individuals at risk may be eligible to participate in clinical trials.
\end{itemize}
\item Predictive testing is not considered appropriate for asymptomatic at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years.
\item Prenatal testing by molecular genetic testing is possible.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Fragile X}
\label{sec:org3461323}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org51a432a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation
or other loss-of-function variant.
\item Males: moderate intellectual disability
\item Females: mild intellectual disability
\item FMR1 pathogenic variants are complex alterations involving non-classic
gene-disrupting alterations (trinucleotide repeat expansion) and
abnormal gene methylation,
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) affected individuals occasionally have an atypical presentation with an IQ above 70,
\begin{itemize}
\item the traditional  demarcation denoting intellectual disability.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Males with an FMR1 full mutation accompanied by aberrant methylation may have a characteristic appearance:
\begin{itemize}
\item large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears
\item connective tissue findings (joint laxity), and large testes after puberty.
\item Behavioral abnormalities, sometimes including autism spectrum disorder, are common.
\end{itemize}
\item fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, and FMR1-related
primary ovarian insufficiency are less severe forms due to smaller
repeats
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgbc4666e}
\begin{itemize}
\item alteration in FMR1.
\item \textgreater{} 99\% of individuals with fragile X syndrome have:
\begin{itemize}
\item lof variant of FMR1 caused by an increased number of CGG
trinucleotide repeats (typically >200)
\item accompanied by aberrant methylation of FMR1
\end{itemize}
\item Other pathogenic variants include:
\begin{itemize}
\item deletions and single-nucleotide variants.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org35cff0b}
\begin{itemize}
\item All mothers of individuals with an FMR1 full mutation (expansion
>200 CGG trinucleotide repeats and abnormal methylation) are
carriers of an FMR1 pathogenic variant.
\item Mothers and their female relatives who are premutation carriers are
at increased risk for FXTAS and POI;
\item those with a full mutation may have findings of fragile X syndrome.
\item All are at increased risk of having offspring with fragile X syndrome, FXTAS, and POI.
\item Males with premutations are at increased risk for FXTAS.
\item Males with FXTAS will transmit their FMR1 premutation expansion to none of their sons and to all of their daughters, who will be premutation carriers.
\item Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the diagnosis of an
FMR1-related disorder has been confirmed in a family member.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Friedreich's ataxia}
\label{sec:org1ec1992}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org3c16d97}
\begin{itemize}
\item characterized by slowly progressive ataxia with onset usually before
age 25 years (mean 10-15 yrs).
\item FRDA is typically associated with dysarthria, muscle weakness,
spasticity particularly in the lower limbs, scoliosis, bladder
dysfunction, absent lower-limb reflexes, and loss of position and
vibration sense.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textasciitilde{}2/3 have cardiomyopathy
\item \textasciitilde{}30\% have diabetes mellitus,
\item \textasciitilde{}25\% have an "atypical" presentation with later onset or retained
tendon reflexes.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org47590de}
\begin{itemize}
\item established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic
variants in FXN.
\item An abnormally expanded GAA repeat in intron 1 of FXN observed on
both alleles in \textasciitilde{}96\% with FRDA
\item remaining are compound heterozygotes for abnormally expanded GAA
repeat in the disease-causing range on one allele and another
intragenic pathogenic variant on the other allele.
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Four classes of alleles are recognized for the GAA repeat sequence in intron 1 of FXN
\begin{description}
\item[{Normal alleles}] 5-33 GAA repeats
\item[{Mutable normal (premutation) alleles}] 34-65 GAA repeats
\item[{Borderline alleles}] 44-66 GAA repeats. The shortest repeat length associated with disease
\item[{Full-penetrance (disease-causing expanded) alleles}] 66-1,300 GAA repeats
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

Rare alleles of variant structure. In contrast to the alleles discussed above in which the GAA trinucleotides are perfect repeats, in rare pathogenic alleles the GAA repeats are not in perfect tandem order but rather are interrupted by other nucleotides. Such "interrupted FXN alleles" differ in length and types of nucleotides in the interruption, but they are typically close to the 3' end of the GAA repeat tract (see Molecular Genetics).
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org7cf27e3}
\begin{itemize}
\item autosomal recessive
\item Each sib has a 25\% chance of being affected
\begin{itemize}
\item 50\% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier
\item 25\% chance of having no pathogenic variant.
\end{itemize}
\item Carrier testing of at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis
are possible if both FXN pathogenic variants have been identified in
an affected family member.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Myotonic dystrophy type I}
\label{sec:org9cb5daf}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org0979ab7}
\begin{itemize}
\item multisystem disorder that affects skeletal and smooth muscle as well
as the eye, heart, endocrine system, and central nervous system.

\item clinical findings, from mild to severe:

\begin{description}
\item[{Mild DM1}] cataract and mild myotonia (sustained muscle
contraction) life span is normal

\item[{Classic DM1}] muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia, cataract,
and often cardiac conduction abnormalities; adults
may become physically disabled and may have a
shortened life span.

\item[{Congenital DM1}] hypotonia and severe generalized weakness at
birth, often with respiratory insufficiency and
early death; intellectual disability is common.
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orge0f37f6}
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the noncoding region of DMPK.
\item molecular genetic testing of DMPK.
\item CTG repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal.
\item Molecular genetic testing detects pathogenic variants in nearly 100\%
of affected individuals.

\begin{description}
\item[{Normal alleles}] 5-34 CTG repeats
\item[{Mutable normal (premutation) alleles}] 35-49 CTG repeats
\item[{Full-penetrance alleles}] \(\ge\) 50 CTG repeats
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgac4cabb}
\begin{itemize}
\item autosomal dominant
\item Offspring of an affected individual have a 50\% chance of inheriting the expanded allele.
\item Pathogenic alleles may expand in length during gametogenesis
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\to\) transmission of longer trinucleotide repeat alleles
\item \(\to\) earlier onset and more severe disease the parent
\end{itemize}
\item Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk when
the diagnosis of DM1 has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing
in an affected family member.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Angelman syndrome}
\label{sec:orge08b868}
\begin{enumerate}

AS and PWS}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item molecular genetic testing deficient expression or function of the
maternally inherited UBE3A allele.
\item parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosome region detects approximately 80\%
\begin{itemize}
\item including deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting defect (ID)
\end{itemize}
\item \textless{} 1\% have a cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangement (i.e., translocation or inversion).
\item UBE3A sequence analysis detects pathogenic variants \textasciitilde{}11\% of individuals.
\item molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence
analysis) \textasciitilde{}90\% of individuals.
\item Remaining 10\% with classic phenotypic features of AS have the
disorder as a result of an as-yet unidentified genetic mechanism
\begin{itemize}
\item not amenable to diagnostic testing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org78aab46}
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by disruption of maternally imprinted UBE3A located within
the 15q11.2-q13 Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome region.
\item The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism
leading to the loss of UBE3A function
\begin{itemize}
\item typically less than 1\% risk for probands with a deletion or UPD
\item as high as 50\% for probands with an ID or a pathogenic variant of UBE3A.
\end{itemize}
\item Members of the mother's extended family are also at increased risk
when an ID or a UBE3A pathogenic variant is present.
\item Cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangements may be inherited,usually \emph{de novo}.
\item Prenatal testing is possible when the underlying genetic mechanism
is a deletion, UPD, an ID, a UBE3A pathogenic variant, or a
chromosome rearrangement.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome}
\label{sec:org069108b}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org2f42595}
\begin{itemize}
\item growth disorder variably characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia,
macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, omphalocele, embryonal
tumors (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and
rhabdomyosarcoma), visceromegaly, adrenocortical cytomegaly, renal
abnormalities (e.g., medullary dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis,
medullary sponge kidney, and nephromegaly), and ear creases/pits.

\item a clinical spectrum, may have many of these features or only one or two.

\item Early death may occur from complications of prematurity,
hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, or tumors.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgc05b1bf}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cytogenetically detectable abnormalities involving chromosome 11p15
are found in 1\% or fewer of affected individuals.

\item Molecular genetic testing can identify epigenetic and genomic
alterations of chromosome 11p15 in individuals with BWS:
\begin{itemize}
\item Loss of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
center 2 (IC2) in 50\% of affected individuals;
\item Paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 11p15 in 20\%
\item Gain of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
center 1 (IC1) in 5\%.
\end{itemize}
\item Methylation alterations associated with deletions or duplications in
this region have high heritability.

\item Sequence analysis of CDKN1C identifies a heterozygous maternally
inherited pathogenic variant in approximately 40\% of familial cases
and 5\%-10\% of cases with no family history of BWS.
\end{itemize}

BWS Chromosome 11}
\end{figure}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org5f260f3}
\begin{itemize}
\item associated with abnormal regulation of gene transcription in two
imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15.5.
\item Most individuals with BWS are reported to have normal chromosome
studies or karyotypes.
\item \textasciitilde{}85\% of individuals with BWS have no family history of BWS
\item \textasciitilde{}15\% have a family history consistent with parent-of-origin
autosomal dominant transmission.
\item Children of subfertile parents conceived by assisted reproductive
technology (ART) may be at increased risk for imprinting disorders,
including BWS.
\item Identification of the underlying genetic mechanism causing BWS
permits better estimation of recurrence risk.
\item Prenatal screening for pregnancies in the general population that
identifies findings suggestive of a diagnosis of BWS may lead to the
consideration of
\begin{itemize}
\item chromosome analysis, chromosomal microarray, and/or molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\item prenatal testing by chromosome analysis for families with an
inherited chromosome abnormality or by molecular genetic testing for
families in which the molecular mechanism of BWS has been defined
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Prader-Willi syndrome}
\label{sec:orge0b8210}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgb18ccbb}
\begin{itemize}
\item severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in early infancy
\item later infancy or early childhood by excessive eating
\item gradual development of morbid obesity
\item Motor milestones and language development are delayed.
\item All individuals have some degree of cognitive impairment.
\item A distinctive behavioral phenotype (with temper tantrums, stubbornness, manipulative behavior, and obsessive-compulsive characteristics) is common.
\item Hypogonadism is present in both males and females and manifests as genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most, infertility.
\item Short stature is common (if not treated with growth hormone);
\item characteristic facial features, strabismus, and scoliosis are often present.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org0ce1ca4}
\begin{itemize}
\item DNA methylation testing to detect abnormal parent-specific
imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) on
chromosome 15
\item testing determines whether the region is maternally inherited only
\begin{itemize}
\item the paternally contributed region is absent
\item detects more than 99\% of affected individuals
\item DNA methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the
diagnosis of PWS in all individuals,
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org31be099}
\begin{itemize}
\item PWS is caused by an absence of expression of imprinted genes in the
paternally derived PWS/Angelman syndrome (AS) region (15q11.2-q13)
of chromosome 15:
\begin{itemize}
\item paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15 and rarely an imprinting defect.
\end{itemize}
\item The risk to the sibs depends on the genetic mechanism.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textless{} 1\% if the affected child has a deletion or uniparental disomy
\item up to 50\% if the affected child has an imprinting defect
\item up to 25\% if a parental chromosome translocation is present
\end{itemize}
\item Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk if
the underlying genetic mechanism is known.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Russell-Silver syndrome}
\label{sec:orgc350057}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org8978299}
\begin{itemize}
\item asymmetric gestational growth restriction resulting in affected
individuals being born small for gestational age, with relative
macrocephaly at birth (head circumference \(\le\)1.5 SD above birth
weight and/or length), prominent forehead usually with frontal
bossing, and frequently body asymmetry.
\item This is followed by postnatal growth failure, and in some cases progressive limb length discrepancy and feeding difficulties.
\item Additional clinical features include triangular facies, fifth-finger clinodactyly, and micrognathia with narrow chin.
\item The average adult height in untreated individuals is \textasciitilde{}3.1\textpm{}1.4 SD below the mean.
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org682c4d9}
\begin{itemize}
\item a genetically heterogeneous condition.
\item Genetic testing confirms clinical diagnosis in approximately 60\% of
affected individuals.
\begin{itemize}
\item hypomethylation of the imprinted control region 1 (ICR1) at
11p15.5 causes SRS in 35\%-50\% of individuals
\item maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD7) causes SRS in 7\%-10\% of individuals.
\item a small number of individuals with SRS who have duplications,
deletions or translocations involving the imprinting centers at
11p15.5 or duplications, deletions, or translocations involving
chromosome 7.
\item rarely, affected individuals with pathogenic variants in CDKN1C,
IGF2, PLAG1, and HMGA2 have been described.
\item approximately 40\% of individuals who meet NH-CSS clinical criteria
for SRS have negative molecular and/or cytogenetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

11p Duplication in RSS}
\end{figure}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org2443af3}
\begin{itemize}
\item SRS has multiple etiologies and typically has a low recurrence
risk.
\item In most families, a proband with SRS represents a simplex case (a single affected family member) and has
SRS as the result of an apparent \emph{de novo} epigenetic or genetic alteration
\begin{itemize}
\item loss of paternal methylation at the 11p15 ICR1 H19/IGF2 imprinting center 1 or
\item maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 7.
\end{itemize}
\item SRS may also occur as the result of a genetic alteration associated with up to a 50\% recurrence risk
\begin{itemize}
\item copy number variant on chromosome 7 or 11 or
\item an intragenic pathogenic  variant in CDKN1C, IGF2, PLAG2, or HMGA2
\end{itemize}
\item Accurate assessment of SRS recurrence therefore requires
identification of the causative genetic mechanism in the proband.
