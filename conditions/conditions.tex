\subsection{Hemophilia A}
\label{sec:orge8fa035}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org705c229}
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in
prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and
delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing.

\item age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to
the level of factor VIII clotting activity.

\item[{severe hemophilia A}] 2 - 5 spontaneous bleeding episodes each month
\begin{itemize}
\item are usually diagnosed during the first 2 years of life following
bleeding from minor injuries.
\item spontaneous joint bleeds or deep-muscle hematomas,
\item prolonged bleeding or excessive pain and swelling from minor
injuries, surgery, and tooth extractions.
\end{itemize}

\item[{moderate hemophilia A}] seldom have spontaneous bleeding;
\begin{itemize}
\item prolonged or delayed oozing after relatively minor trauma
\item usually diagnosed before age 5 or 6
\end{itemize}

\item[{mild hemophilia A }] do nothave spontaneous bleeding episodes;
\begin{itemize}
\item without pre- and postoperative treatment, abnormal bleeding occurs with surgery
or tooth extractions
\item often not diagnosed until later in life
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org48b8aee}
\begin{itemize}
\item low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal,
functional von Willebrand factor level
\item a hemizygous F8 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
diagnosis.
\item a heterozygous F8 pathogenic variant in a symptomatic female
confirms the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgbfb3148}
\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked
\item risk to sibs of a proband depends on the carrier status of the mother.
\item Carrier females have a 50\% chance of transmitting the F8 pathogenic
variant in each pregnancy:
\begin{itemize}
\item sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected
\item daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are carriers.
\end{itemize}
\item Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their
daughters and none of their sons.
\item Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the F8 pathogenic
variant has been identified or if informative intragenic linked
markers have been identified.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hemophilia B}
\label{sec:orgc258c21}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org0bebe4d}
\begin{itemize}
\item deficiency in factor IX clotting
\item same as Hemophilia A (section \ref{sec:orge8fa035})
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgf745c8b}
\begin{itemize}
\item low factor IX clotting activity
\item hemizygous F9 pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the
diagnosis.
\item heterozygous F9 pathogenic variant on in a symptomatic female
confirms the diagnosis.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org4720845}
\begin{itemize}
\item same as Hemophilia A (section \ref{sec:orge8fa035})
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Hemochromatosis}
\label{sec:orgc99abbe}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:orgd5ead39}
\begin{itemize}
\item inappropriately high absorption of iron by the small intestinal
mucosa.

\item The phenotypic spectrum of HFE hemochromatosis includes:

\item[{Clinical HFE hemochromatosis}] manifestations of end-organ damage secondary to iron overload are present
\begin{itemize}
\item excessive storage of iron in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, and anterior pituitary gland.
\item early symptoms include: abdominal pain, weakness, lethargy, weight loss, arthralgias, diabetes mellitus; and increased risk of cirrhosis
\end{itemize}
\item[{Biochemical HFE hemochromatosis}] \(\uparrow\) transferrin-iron saturation, and the only evidence of iron overload is \(\uparrow\) serum ferritin
\item[{Non-expressing p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes}] neither clinical manifestations of HFE hemochromatosis nor iron overload are present
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org303ab9c}
\begin{itemize}
\item biallelic HFE pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:orgc56e1b9}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR
\item[{Risk to sibs}] When both parents of a person with hemochromatosis are heterozygous for an HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant, the risk to sibs of inheriting two HFE p.Cys282Tyr variants is 25\%.
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the HFE p.Cys282Tyr heterozygote prevalence in persons of European origin is high (11\%, or 1/9), some parents of HFE p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes have two abnormal HFE alleles.
\item If one parent is heterozygous and the other parent homozygous for two abnormal HFE alleles, the risk to each sib of inheriting two HFE pathogenic alleles is 50\%.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Risk to offspring}] Offspring of an individual with HFE hemochromatosis inherit one HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant from the parent with HFE hemochromatosis.
\begin{itemize}
\item Because the chance that the other parent is a heterozygote for HFE p.Cys282Tyr is 1/9, the risk that the offspring will inherit two HFE p.Cys282Tyr variants is approximately 5\%.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Prenatal testing}] not usually performed because HFE hemochromatosis is an adult-onset, treatable disorder with low clinical penetrance.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation
or other loss-of-function variant.
\item Males: moderate intellectual disability
\item Females: mild intellectual disability
\item FMR1 pathogenic variants are complex alterations involving non-classic
gene-disrupting alterations (trinucleotide repeat expansion) and
abnormal gene methylation,
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) affected individuals occasionally have an atypical presentation with an IQ above 70,
\begin{itemize}
\item the traditional  demarcation denoting intellectual disability.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Males with an FMR1 full mutation accompanied by aberrant methylation may have a characteristic appearance:
\begin{itemize}
\item large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears
\item connective tissue findings (joint laxity), and large testes after puberty.
\item Behavioral abnormalities, sometimes including autism spectrum disorder, are common.
\end{itemize}
\item fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, and FMR1-related
primary ovarian insufficiency are less severe forms due to smaller
repeats
\end{itemize}

\item lof variant of FMR1 caused by an increased number of CGG
trinucleotide repeats (typically >200)
\item accompanied by aberrant methylation of FMR1
\end{itemize}
\item Other pathogenic variants include:
\begin{itemize}
\item deletions and single-nucleotide variants.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org4280f92}
\begin{itemize}
\item All mothers of individuals with an FMR1 full mutation (expansion
>200 CGG trinucleotide repeats and abnormal methylation) are
carriers of an FMR1 pathogenic variant.
\item Mothers and their female relatives who are premutation carriers are
at increased risk for FXTAS and POI;
\item those with a full mutation may have findings of fragile X syndrome.
\item All are at increased risk of having offspring with fragile X syndrome, FXTAS, and POI.
\item Males with premutations are at increased risk for FXTAS.
\item Males with FXTAS will transmit their FMR1 premutation expansion to none of their sons and to all of their daughters, who will be premutation carriers.
\item Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the diagnosis of an
FMR1-related disorder has been confirmed in a family member.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic
variants in FXN.
\item An abnormally expanded GAA repeat in intron 1 of FXN observed on
both alleles in \textasciitilde{}96\% with FRDA
\item remaining are compound heterozygotes for abnormally expanded GAA
repeat in the disease-causing range on one allele and another
intragenic pathogenic variant on the other allele.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org48d13ce}
\begin{itemize}
\item autosomal recessive
\item Each sib has a 25\% chance of being affected
\begin{itemize}
\item 50\% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier
\item 25\% chance of having no pathogenic variant.
\end{itemize}
\item Carrier testing of at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for
pregnancies at increased risk, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis
are possible if both FXN pathogenic variants have been identified in
an affected family member.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Myotonic dystrophy type I}
\label{sec:org66f0b77}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics

contraction) life span is normal

\item[{Classic DM1}] muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia, cataract, and
often cardiac conduction abnormalities; adults may
become physically disabled and may have a shortened
life span.

\item[{Congenital DM1}] is characterized by hypotonia and severe
generalized weakness at birth, often with
respiratory insufficiency and early death;
intellectual disability is common.
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgf950a03}
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the noncoding region of DMPK.
\item molecular genetic testing of DMPK.
\item CTG repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal.
\item Molecular genetic testing detects pathogenic variants in nearly 100\%
of affected individuals.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org952a53e}
\begin{itemize}
\item autosomal dominant
\item Offspring of an affected individual have a 50\% chance of inheriting the expanded allele.
\item Pathogenic alleles may expand in length during gametogenesis
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\to\) transmission of longer trinucleotide repeat alleles
\item \(\to\) earlier onset and more severe disease the parent

AS and PWS}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item molecular genetic testing deficient expression or function of the
maternally inherited UBE3A allele.
\item parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosome region detects approximately 80\%
\begin{itemize}
\item including deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting defect (ID)
\end{itemize}
\item \textless{} 1\% have a cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangement (i.e., translocation or inversion).
\item UBE3A sequence analysis detects pathogenic variants \textasciitilde{}11\% of individuals.
\item molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence
analysis) \textasciitilde{}90\% of individuals.
\item Remaining 10\% with classic phenotypic features of AS have the
disorder as a result of an as-yet unidentified genetic mechanism
\begin{itemize}
\item not amenable to diagnostic testing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org4eb4bab}
\begin{itemize}
\item caused by disruption of maternally imprinted UBE3A located within
the 15q11.2-q13 Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome region.
\item The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism
leading to the loss of UBE3A function
\begin{itemize}
\item typically less than 1\% risk for probands with a deletion or UPD
\item as high as 50\% for probands with an ID or a pathogenic variant of UBE3A.
\end{itemize}
\item Members of the mother's extended family are also at increased risk
when an ID or a UBE3A pathogenic variant is present.
\item Cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangements may be inherited,usually \emph{de novo}.
\item Prenatal testing is possible when the underlying genetic mechanism
is a deletion, UPD, an ID, a UBE3A pathogenic variant, or a
chromosome rearrangement.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome}
\label{sec:orgd54172a}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Characteristics
\label{sec:org6e5c4fe}
\begin{itemize}
\item growth disorder variably characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia,
macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, omphalocele, embryonal
tumors (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and
rhabdomyosarcoma), visceromegaly, adrenocortical cytomegaly, renal
abnormalities (e.g., medullary dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis,
medullary sponge kidney, and nephromegaly), and ear creases/pits.

\item a clinical spectrum, may have many of these features or only one or two.

\item Early death may occur from complications of prematurity,
hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, or tumors.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orge99cb72}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cytogenetically detectable abnormalities involving chromosome 11p15
are found in 1\% or fewer of affected individuals.

\item Molecular genetic testing can identify epigenetic and genomic
alterations of chromosome 11p15 in individuals with BWS:
\begin{itemize}
\item Loss of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
center 2 (IC2) in 50\% of affected individuals;
\item Paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 11p15 in 20\%
\item Gain of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
center 1 (IC1) in 5\%.
\end{itemize}
\item Methylation alterations associated with deletions or duplications in
this region have high heritability.

\item Sequence analysis of CDKN1C identifies a heterozygous maternally
inherited pathogenic variant in approximately 40\% of familial cases
and 5\%-10\% of cases with no family history of BWS.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org5b886fc}
\begin{itemize}
\item associated with abnormal regulation of gene transcription in two
imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15.5.
\item Most individuals with BWS are reported to have normal chromosome
studies or karyotypes.
\item \textasciitilde{}85\% of individuals with BWS have no family history of BWS
\item \textasciitilde{}15\% have a family history consistent with parent-of-origin
autosomal dominant transmission.
\item Children of subfertile parents conceived by assisted reproductive
technology (ART) may be at increased risk for imprinting disorders,
including BWS.
\item Identification of the underlying genetic mechanism causing BWS
permits better estimation of recurrence risk.
\item Prenatal screening for pregnancies in the general population that
identifies findings suggestive of a diagnosis of BWS may lead to the
consideration of
\begin{itemize}
\item chromosome analysis, chromosomal microarray, and/or molecular genetic testing.
\end{itemize}
\item prenatal testing by chromosome analysis for families with an
inherited chromosome abnormality or by molecular genetic testing for
families in which the molecular mechanism of BWS has been defined
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Prader-Willi syndrome}
\label{sec:org3405cba}

\item later infancy or early childhood by excessive eating
\item gradual development of morbid obesity
\item Motor milestones and language development are delayed.
\item All individuals have some degree of cognitive impairment.
\item A distinctive behavioral phenotype (with temper tantrums, stubbornness, manipulative behavior, and obsessive-compulsive characteristics) is common.
\item Hypogonadism is present in both males and females and manifests as genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most, infertility.
\item Short stature is common (if not treated with growth hormone);
\item characteristic facial features, strabismus, and scoliosis are often present.
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:org7587ec0}
\begin{itemize}
\item DNA methylation testing to detect abnormal parent-specific
imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) on
chromosome 15
\item testing determines whether the region is maternally inherited only
\begin{itemize}
\item the paternally contributed region is absent
\item detects more than 99\% of affected individuals
\item DNA methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the
diagnosis of PWS in all individuals,
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetic Counseling
\label{sec:org00f574f}
\begin{itemize}
\item PWS is caused by an absence of expression of imprinted genes in the
paternally derived PWS/Angelman syndrome (AS) region (15q11.2-q13)
of chromosome 15:
\begin{itemize}
\item paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15 and rarely an imprinting defect.
\end{itemize}
\item The risk to the sibs depends on the genetic mechanism.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textless{} 1\% if the affected child has a deletion or uniparental disomy
\item up to 50\% if the affected child has an imprinting defect
\item up to 25\% if a parental chromosome translocation is present
\end{itemize}
