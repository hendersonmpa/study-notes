* Cystic Fibrosis
** Clinical Characteristics
- multisystem disease affecting epithelia of the respiratory tract, exocrine pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, and exocrine sweat glands
- morbidities include progressive obstructive lung disease with bronchiectasis, frequent hospitalizations for pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency and malnutrition, recurrent sinusitis and bronchitis, and male infertility
- pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF
- meconium ileus occurs at birth in 15%-20% of newborns with CF
- \gt 95% of males with CF are infertile

** Diagnostic Testing
- one or more characteristic phenotypic features and evidence of an abnormality in CFTR function
  - 2 elevated sweat chloride values or
  - biallelic CFTR pathogenic variants or 
  - transepithelial nasal potential difference measurement characteristic of CF
- diagnosis of CF is established in an infant with:
  - elevated NBS IRT and
  - identification of biallelic CFTR pathogenic variants or
  - an elevated sweat chloride.
    - quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride values (>60 mmol/L in infants age > 6 months) 
** Genetic Counselling
- AR CFTR

* Achondroplasia
** Clinical Characteristics
- most common cause of disproportionate short stature
- affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs,
  macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal
  bossing and midface retrusion
- in infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental
  motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed
- intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although
  craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in
  infancy
- additional complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear
  dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis

** Diagnostic Testing
- Diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in
  most affected individuals.
- In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or atypical
  findings, identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in
  FGFR3 can establish the diagnosis.

** Genetic Counselling
- AD, FGFR3
- ~80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average
  stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a /de novo/
  pathogenic variant.
  - these parents have a very low risk of having another child with
    achondroplasia.

* Huntington Disease
** Clinical Characteristics
- a progressive disorder of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric
  disturbances
- mean age of onset is 35 to 44 years and the median survival time is
  15 to 18 years after onset
** Diagnostic Testing
- diagnosis of HD rests on:
  - positive family history
  - characteristic clinical findings
  - detection of an expansion of \ge 36 CAG trinucleotide repeats in HTT
- all individuals with HD have an expansion in the number of CAG
  trinucleotide repeats that encode glutamine amino acids in exon 1 of
  HTT
  - Normal alleles :: \le 26 CAG trinucleotide repeats
  - Intermediate alleles :: 27-35 CAG trinucleotide repeats
    - an individual with an allele in this range is not at risk of
      developing symptoms of HD but, because of instability in the CAG
      tract, may be at risk of having a child with an allele in the
      HD-causing range
  - HD-causing alleles :: \ge 36 CAG trinucleotide repeats
    - at risk of developing HD in their lifetime
    - HD-causing alleles are further classified as:
      - Reduced-penetrance HD-causing alleles :: 36-39 CAG 
      - Full-penetrance HD-causing alleles :: \ge 40 CAG 
** Genetic Counselling
- AD HTT
- offspring of an individual with a pathogenic variant have a 50%
  chance of inheriting the disease-causing allele
- predictive testing in asymptomatic adults at risk is available but
  requires careful thought (including pre- and post-test genetic
  counselling) as there is currently no cure for the disorder
  - asymptomatic individuals at risk may be eligible to participate in
    clinical trials
- predictive testing is not considered appropriate for asymptomatic
  at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years
- prenatal testing by molecular genetic testing is possible
* Fragile X
** Clinical Characteristics
- Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation
  or other loss-of-function variant
  - \male{} moderate intellectual disability
  - \female{} mild intellectual disability
- FMR1 pathogenic variants are complex alterations involving non-classic
  gene-disrupting alterations (trinucleotide repeat expansion) and
  abnormal gene methylation
  - \therefore affected individuals occasionally have an atypical
    presentation with an IQ above 70
    - the traditional  demarcation denoting intellectual disability
- \male{} with an FMR1 full mutation accompanied by aberrant
  methylation may have a characteristic appearance:
  - large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears
  - connective tissue findings (joint laxity), and large testes after puberty
  - behavioral abnormalities, sometimes including autism spectrum disorder, are common
- fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and
  FMR1-related primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) are less severe
  forms due to smaller repeats
** Diagnostic Testing
- alteration in FMR1
- \gt 99% of individuals with fragile X syndrome have:
  - LOF variant of FMR1 caused by an increased number of CGG
    trinucleotide repeats (typically \gt200)
  - accompanied by aberrant methylation of FMR1
- other pathogenic variants include:
  - deletions and single-nucleotide variants
** Genetic Counselling
- all mothers of individuals with an FMR1 full mutation (expansion
  >200 CGG trinucleotide repeats and abnormal methylation) are
  carriers of an FMR1 pathogenic variant
- mothers and their female relatives who are premutation carriers are
  at increased risk for FXTAS and POI
  - at increased risk of having offspring with fragile X syndrome, FXTAS, and POI
  - those with a full mutation may have findings of fragile X syndrome.
- \male{} with premutations are at increased risk for FXTAS
- \male{} with FXTAS will transmit their FMR1 premutation expansion to
  none of their sons and to all of their daughters, who will be
  premutation carriers
- carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for
  pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the diagnosis of an
  FMR1-related disorder has been confirmed in a family member
* Friedreich's Ataxia
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by slowly progressive ataxia with onset usually before
  age 25 years (mean 10-15 yrs)
- FRDA is typically associated with dysarthria, muscle weakness,
  spasticity particularly in the lower limbs, scoliosis, bladder
  dysfunction, absent lower-limb reflexes, and loss of position and
  vibration sense
  - ~2/3 have cardiomyopathy
  - ~30% have diabetes mellitus,
  - ~25% have an "atypical" presentation with later onset or retained
    tendon reflexes
** Diagnostic Testing
- established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic
  variants in FXN
- An abnormally expanded GAA repeat in intron 1 of FXN observed on
  both alleles in ~96% with FRDA
- remaining are compound heterozygotes for abnormally expanded GAA
  repeat in the disease-causing range on one allele and another
  intragenic pathogenic variant on the other allele
- four classes of alleles are recognized for the GAA repeat sequence in intron 1 of FXN
  - Normal alleles :: 5-33 GAA repeats
  - Mutable normal (premutation) alleles :: 34-65 GAA repeats
  - Borderline alleles :: 44-66 GAA repeats
    -  the shortest repeat length associated with disease 
  - Full-penetrance (disease-causing expanded) alleles :: 66-1,300 GAA repeats

** Genetic Counselling
- AR FXN

* Myotonic Dystrophy Type I
** Clinical Characteristics
- multisystem disorder that affects skeletal and smooth muscle as well
  as the eye, heart, endocrine system, and central nervous system

- clinical findings, from mild to severe:
  - Mild DM1 :: cataract and mild myotonia (sustained muscle
                contraction) life span is normal
  - Classic DM1 :: muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia, cataract,
                   and often cardiac conduction abnormalities; adults
                   may become physically disabled and may have a
                   shortened life span
  - Congenital DM1 :: hypotonia and severe generalized weakness at
                      birth, often with respiratory insufficiency and
                      early death; intellectual disability is common
** Diagnostic Testing
- caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the noncoding region of DMPK
- molecular genetic testing of DMPK
- CTG repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal
- molecular genetic testing detects pathogenic variants in nearly 100%
  of affected individuals

  - Normal alleles :: 5-34 CTG repeats
  - Mutable normal (premutation) alleles :: 35-49 CTG repeats
  - Full-penetrance alleles ::  \ge 50 CTG repeats

** Genetic Counselling
- AD DMPK
- offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting
  the expanded allele
- pathogenic alleles may expand in length during gametogenesis
  - \to transmission of longer trinucleotide repeat alleles
  -  \to earlier onset and more severe disease the parent
* Angelman Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- severe developmental delay or intellectual disability, severe speech
  impairment, gait ataxia and/or tremulousness of the limbs
- unique behavior with an inappropriate happy demeanor that includes
  frequent laughing, smiling, and excitability
- microcephaly and seizures are also common
- developmental delays are first noted at around age six months
- clinical features of AS do not become manifest until after age one year
  - can take several years before the correct clinical diagnosis is obvious

** Diagnostic Testing

#+CAPTION[]: AS and PWS
#+NAME: fig:as_pws
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.6\textwidth
[[file:./figures/aspws.jpg]]

- molecular genetic testing for deficient expression or function of
  the *maternally inherited UBE3A allele* (Figure [[fig:as_pws]])
- parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosome region detects approximately 80%
  - including deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting defect (ID)
- \lt 1% have a cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangement (i.e., translocation or inversion)
- UBE3A sequence analysis detects pathogenic variants ~11% of individuals
- molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence
  analysis) ~90% of individuals
- remaining 10% with classic phenotypic features of AS have the
  disorder as a result of an as-yet unidentified genetic mechanism
  - not amenable to diagnostic testing
** Genetic Counselling
- caused by disruption of *maternally imprinted UBE3A* located within
  the 15q11.2-q13 Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome region.
- risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism leading
  to the loss of UBE3A function
  - typically less than 1% risk for probands with a deletion or UPD
  - as high as 50% for probands with an ID or a pathogenic variant of UBE3A
- members of the mother's extended family are also at increased risk
  when an ID or a UBE3A pathogenic variant is present
- cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangements may be
  inherited, usually /de novo/
- prenatal testing is possible when the underlying genetic mechanism
  is a deletion, UPD, an ID, a UBE3A pathogenic variant, or a
  chromosome rearrangement
* Prader-Willi Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in early infancy
- excessive eating later infancy or early childhood
  - gradual development of morbid obesity
- motor milestones and language development are delayed
- all individuals have some degree of cognitive impairment
- a distinctive behavioral phenotype (with temper tantrums,
  stubbornness, manipulative behavior, and obsessive-compulsive
  characteristics) is common
- hypogonadism is present in both males and females and manifests as
  genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most,
  infertility
- short stature is common (if not treated with growth hormone)
- characteristic facial features, strabismus, and scoliosis are often
  present

** Diagnostic Testing
 - DNA methylation testing to detect abnormal parent-specific
   imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) on
   chromosome 15 (Figure [[fig:as_pws]])
 - testing determines whether the region is maternally inherited only
   - the paternally contributed region is absent
   - detects more than 99% of affected individuals
   - DNA methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the
     diagnosis of PWS in all individuals,

** Genetic Counselling
- PWS is caused by an *absence of expression of imprinted genes in the*
  *paternally derived PWS/Angelman syndrome (AS) region (15q11.2-q13)*
  *of chromosome 15*:
  - paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15 and rarely an imprinting defect
- risk to the sibs depends on the genetic mechanism
  - \lt 1% if the affected child has a deletion or uniparental disomy
  - up to 50% if the affected child has an imprinting defect
  - up to 25% if a parental chromosome translocation is present

* Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- growth disorder variably characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia,
  macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, omphalocele, embryonal
  tumors (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and
  rhabdomyosarcoma), visceromegaly, adrenocortical cytomegaly, renal
  abnormalities (e.g., medullary dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis,
  medullary sponge kidney, and nephromegaly), and ear creases/pits

- a clinical spectrum, may have many of these features or only one or two

- early death may occur from complications of prematurity,
  hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, or tumors

** Diagnostic Testing

- Cytogenetically detectable abnormalities involving chromosome 11p15
  are found in 1% or fewer of affected individuals
- molecular genetic testing can identify epigenetic and genomic
  alterations of chromosome 11p15 in individuals with BWS:
  - loss of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
    center 2 (IC2) in 50% of affected individuals;
  - paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 11p15 in 20%
  - gain of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
    center 1 (IC1) in 5%
- methylation alterations associated with deletions or duplications in
  this region have high heritability
- sequence analysis of CDKN1C identifies a heterozygous maternally
  inherited pathogenic variant in approximately 40% of familial cases
  and 5%-10% of cases with no family history of BWS

#+CAPTION[]:BWS Chromosome 11
#+NAME: fig:bws
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.5\textwidth
[[file:./figures/bws.png]]

** Genetic Counselling
- associated with abnormal regulation of gene transcription in two
  imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15.5
- most individuals with BWS are reported to have normal chromosome
  studies or karyotypes
- ~85% of individuals with BWS have no family history of BWS
- ~15% have a family history consistent with parent-of-origin
  autosomal dominant transmission
- children of subfertile parents conceived by assisted reproductive
  technology may be at increased risk for imprinting disorders,
  including BWS
- identification of the underlying genetic mechanism causing BWS
  permits better estimation of recurrence risk
- prenatal screening for pregnancies in the general population that
  identifies findings suggestive of a diagnosis of BWS may lead to the
  consideration of chromosome analysis, chromosomal microarray, and/or
  molecular genetic testing

* Russell-Silver Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- asymmetric gestational growth restriction resulting in affected
  individuals being born small for gestational age, with relative
  macrocephaly at birth,prominent forehead usually with frontal
  bossing, and frequently body asymmetry
  - followed by postnatal growth failure, and in some cases progressive
    limb length discrepancy and feeding difficulties
- additional clinical features include triangular facies, fifth-finger
  clinodactyly, and micrognathia with narrow chin
- the average adult height in untreated individuals is ~3 SD below the
  mean
** Diagnostic Testing
- a genetically heterogeneous condition
- genetic testing confirms clinical diagnosis in approximately 60% of
  affected individuals
  - hypomethylation of the imprinted control region 1 (ICR1) at
    11p15.5 in 35%-50% of individuals
  - maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD7) in 7%-10% of
    individuals
  - a small number of individuals have duplications, deletions or
    translocations involving the imprinting centers at 11p15.5 or
    duplications, deletions, or translocations involving chromosome 7
  - rarely, affected individuals with pathogenic variants in CDKN1C,
    IGF2, PLAG1, and HMGA2 have been described
  - approximately 40% of individuals who meet NH-CSS clinical criteria
    for RSS have negative molecular and/or cytogenetic testing.

#+CAPTION[]:11p Duplication in RSS
#+NAME: fig:rss
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.5\textwidth
[[file:./figures/rss.png]]

** Genetic Counselling
- multiple etiologies and typically has a low recurrence risk
- in most families, a proband with RSS represents a simplex case (a
  single affected family member) and has RSS as the result of an
  apparent /de novo/ epigenetic or genetic alteration
  - loss of paternal methylation at the 11p15 ICR1 H19/IGF2 imprinting center 1 or
  - maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome
- RSS may also occur as the result of a genetic alteration associated
  with up to a 50% recurrence risk
  - copy number variant on chromosome 7 or 11 or
  - an intragenic pathogenic variant in CDKN1C, IGF2, PLAG2, or HMGA2
- accurate assessment of recurrence therefore requires
  identification of the causative genetic mechanism in the proband
