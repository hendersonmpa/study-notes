* Fragile X
** Clinical Characteristics
- Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation
  or other loss-of-function variant.
- Males: moderate intellectual disability
- Females: mild intellectual disability
- FMR1 pathogenic variants are complex alterations involving non-classic
  gene-disrupting alterations (trinucleotide repeat expansion) and
  abnormal gene methylation,
  - \therefore affected individuals occasionally have an atypical presentation with an IQ above 70,
    - the traditional  demarcation denoting intellectual disability.
- Males with an FMR1 full mutation accompanied by aberrant methylation may have a characteristic appearance:
  - large head, long face, prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears
  - connective tissue findings (joint laxity), and large testes after puberty.
  - Behavioral abnormalities, sometimes including autism spectrum disorder, are common.
- fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, and FMR1-related
  primary ovarian insufficiency are less severe forms due to smaller
  repeats
** Diagnostic Testing
- alteration in FMR1.
- \gt 99% of individuals with fragile X syndrome have:
  - lof variant of FMR1 caused by an increased number of CGG
    trinucleotide repeats (typically >200)
  - accompanied by aberrant methylation of FMR1
- Other pathogenic variants include:
  - deletions and single-nucleotide variants.
** Genetic Counseling
- All mothers of individuals with an FMR1 full mutation (expansion
  >200 CGG trinucleotide repeats and abnormal methylation) are
  carriers of an FMR1 pathogenic variant.
- Mothers and their female relatives who are premutation carriers are
  at increased risk for FXTAS and POI;
- those with a full mutation may have findings of fragile X syndrome.
- All are at increased risk of having offspring with fragile X syndrome, FXTAS, and POI.
- Males with premutations are at increased risk for FXTAS.
- Males with FXTAS will transmit their FMR1 premutation expansion to none of their sons and to all of their daughters, who will be premutation carriers.
- Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for
  pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the diagnosis of an
  FMR1-related disorder has been confirmed in a family member.
* Friedreich's ataxia
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by slowly progressive ataxia with onset usually before
  age 25 years (mean 10-15 yrs).
- FRDA is typically associated with dysarthria, muscle weakness,
  spasticity particularly in the lower limbs, scoliosis, bladder
  dysfunction, absent lower-limb reflexes, and loss of position and
  vibration sense.
- ~2/3 have cardiomyopathy
- ~30% have diabetes mellitus,
- ~25% have an "atypical" presentation with later onset or retained
  tendon reflexes.
** Diagnostic Testing
- established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic
  variants in FXN.
- An abnormally expanded GAA repeat in intron 1 of FXN observed on
  both alleles in ~96% with FRDA
- remaining are compound heterozygotes for abnormally expanded GAA
  repeat in the disease-causing range on one allele and another
  intragenic pathogenic variant on the other allele.

** Genetic Counseling
- autosomal recessive
- Each sib has a 25% chance of being affected
  - 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier
  - 25% chance of having no pathogenic variant.
- Carrier testing of at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for
  pregnancies at increased risk, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis
  are possible if both FXN pathogenic variants have been identified in
  an affected family member.

* Myotonic dystrophy type I
** Clinical Characteristics
- multisystem disorder that affects skeletal and smooth muscle as well
  as the eye, heart, endocrine system, and central nervous system.

- clinical findings, from mild to severe:

- Mild DM1 :: cataract and mild myotonia (sustained muscle
              contraction) life span is normal

- Classic DM1 :: muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia, cataract, and
                 often cardiac conduction abnormalities; adults may
                 become physically disabled and may have a shortened
                 life span.

- Congenital DM1 :: is characterized by hypotonia and severe
                    generalized weakness at birth, often with
                    respiratory insufficiency and early death;
                    intellectual disability is common.
** Diagnostic Testing
- caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the noncoding region of DMPK.
- molecular genetic testing of DMPK.
- CTG repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal.
- Molecular genetic testing detects pathogenic variants in nearly 100%
  of affected individuals.

** Genetic Counseling
- autosomal dominant
- Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the expanded allele.
- Pathogenic alleles may expand in length during gametogenesis
  - \to transmission of longer trinucleotide repeat alleles
  -  \to earlier onset and more severe disease the parent
- Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk when
  the diagnosis of DM1 has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing
  in an affected family member.
* Angelman syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- Severe developmental delay or intellectual disability, severe speech
  impairment, gait ataxia and/or tremulousness of the limbs
- unique behavior with an inappropriate happy demeanor that includes
  frequent laughing, smiling, and excitability.
- Microcephaly and seizures are also common.
- Developmental delays are first noted at around age six months
- clinical features of AS do not become manifest until after age one year
  - can take several years before the correct clinical diagnosis is obvious.

- molecular genetic testing deficient expression or function of the
  maternally inherited UBE3A allele.
- parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosome region detects approximately 80%
  - including deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting defect (ID)
- \lt 1% have a cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangement (i.e., translocation or inversion).
- UBE3A sequence analysis detects pathogenic variants ~11% of individuals.
- molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence
  analysis) ~90% of individuals.
- Remaining 10% with classic phenotypic features of AS have the
  disorder as a result of an as-yet unidentified genetic mechanism
  - not amenable to diagnostic testing
** COMMENT Management
- Routine management of feeding difficulties, constipation,
  gastroesophageal reflux, strabismus.
- Antiepileptic drugs for seizures. Physical therapy, occupational
  therapy, and speech therapy with an emphasis on nonverbal methods of
  communication, including augmentative communication aids
** Genetic Counseling
- caused by disruption of maternally imprinted UBE3A located within
  the 15q11.2-q13 Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome region.
- The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism
  leading to the loss of UBE3A function
  - typically less than 1% risk for probands with a deletion or UPD
  - as high as 50% for probands with an ID or a pathogenic variant of UBE3A.
- Members of the mother's extended family are also at increased risk
  when an ID or a UBE3A pathogenic variant is present.
- Cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangements may be inherited,usually /de novo/.
- Prenatal testing is possible when the underlying genetic mechanism
  is a deletion, UPD, an ID, a UBE3A pathogenic variant, or a
  chromosome rearrangement.
* Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- growth disorder variably characterized by neonatal hypoglycemia,
  macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, omphalocele, embryonal
  tumors (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and
  rhabdomyosarcoma), visceromegaly, adrenocortical cytomegaly, renal
  abnormalities (e.g., medullary dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis,
  medullary sponge kidney, and nephromegaly), and ear creases/pits.

- a clinical spectrum, may have many of these features or only one or two.

- Early death may occur from complications of prematurity,
  hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, or tumors.

** Diagnostic Testing

- Cytogenetically detectable abnormalities involving chromosome 11p15
  are found in 1% or fewer of affected individuals.

- Molecular genetic testing can identify epigenetic and genomic
  alterations of chromosome 11p15 in individuals with BWS:
  - Loss of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
    center 2 (IC2) in 50% of affected individuals;
  - Paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 11p15 in 20%
  - Gain of methylation on the maternal chromosome at imprinting
    center 1 (IC1) in 5%.
- Methylation alterations associated with deletions or duplications in
  this region have high heritability.

- Sequence analysis of CDKN1C identifies a heterozygous maternally
  inherited pathogenic variant in approximately 40% of familial cases
  and 5%-10% of cases with no family history of BWS.

** Genetic Counseling
- associated with abnormal regulation of gene transcription in two
  imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15.5.
- Most individuals with BWS are reported to have normal chromosome
  studies or karyotypes.
- ~85% of individuals with BWS have no family history of BWS
- ~15% have a family history consistent with parent-of-origin
  autosomal dominant transmission.
- Children of subfertile parents conceived by assisted reproductive
  technology (ART) may be at increased risk for imprinting disorders,
  including BWS.
- Identification of the underlying genetic mechanism causing BWS
  permits better estimation of recurrence risk.
- Prenatal screening for pregnancies in the general population that
  identifies findings suggestive of a diagnosis of BWS may lead to the
  consideration of
  - chromosome analysis, chromosomal microarray, and/or molecular genetic testing.
- prenatal testing by chromosome analysis for families with an
  inherited chromosome abnormality or by molecular genetic testing for
  families in which the molecular mechanism of BWS has been defined

* Prader-Willi syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in early infancy
- later infancy or early childhood by excessive eating
- gradual development of morbid obesity
- Motor milestones and language development are delayed.
- All individuals have some degree of cognitive impairment.
- A distinctive behavioral phenotype (with temper tantrums, stubbornness, manipulative behavior, and obsessive-compulsive characteristics) is common.
- Hypogonadism is present in both males and females and manifests as genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most, infertility.
- Short stature is common (if not treated with growth hormone);
- characteristic facial features, strabismus, and scoliosis are often present.

** Diagnostic Testing
 - DNA methylation testing to detect abnormal parent-specific
   imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) on
   chromosome 15
 - testing determines whether the region is maternally inherited only
   - the paternally contributed region is absent
   - detects more than 99% of affected individuals
   - DNA methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the
     diagnosis of PWS in all individuals,

** COMMENT Management
- In infancy, special nipples or enteral tube feeding to assure adequate nutrition
  - physical therapy may improve muscle strength; hormonal and surgical treatments can be considered for cryptorchidism.
- In childhood, strict supervision of daily food intake based on height, weight, and BMI to provide energy requirements while limiting excessive weight gain
  - encouraging physical activity.
- Growth hormone replacement therapy to normalize height, increase lean body mass and mobility, and decrease fat mass.
- Evaluation and treatment of sleep disturbance per the general
  population.
- Educational planning should be instigated and speech
  therapy provided if needed.

** Genetic Counseling
- PWS is caused by an absence of expression of imprinted genes in the
  paternally derived PWS/Angelman syndrome (AS) region (15q11.2-q13)
  of chromosome 15:
  - paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15 and rarely an imprinting defect.
- The risk to the sibs depends on the genetic mechanism.
  - \lt 1% if the affected child has a deletion or uniparental disomy
  - up to 50% if the affected child has an imprinting defect
  - up to 25% if a parental chromosome translocation is present
- Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk if
  the underlying genetic mechanism is known.
