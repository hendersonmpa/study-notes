* Alzheimer disease
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by dementia that typically begins with subtle and
  poorly recognized failure of memory and slowly becomes more severe
  and, eventually, incapacitating
** Diagnostic Testing
- \sim 20 suseptibility genes including APOE e4 allele
- early-onset familial alzheimer disease (EOFAD)
  - pathogenic variantAPP, PSEN1 & 2
** Genetic Counseling
- EOFAD in which an individual has a pathogenic variant in APP, PSEN1,
  or PSEN2 represents an autosomal dominant disease
* Congenital hearing loss
** Clinical Characteristics
- hearing loss present at birth
** Diagnostic Testing
- congenital CMV infection
- GJB2 at exon 1 and 2
- GJB6 deletions
- DFNB1 
** Genetic Counseling
- GJB2, GJB6 DFNB1 
* Diabetes Mellitus Type I 
** Clinical Characteristics
- very little or no insulin is produced by the pancreas
- progressive \beta cell destruction leads to dysfunction in the
  neighboring \alpha cells which secrete glucagon, exacerbating
  excursions away from euglycemia in both directions; overproduction
  of glucagon after meals causes sharper hyperglycemia, and failure to
  stimulate glucagon upon incipient hypoglycemia prevents a
  glucagon-mediated rescue of glucose levels
** Diagnostic Testing
- causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, although several risk factors
  have been identified
- the risk of developing type 1 diabetes is increased by certain
  variants of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 genes
- human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex helps the immune system
  distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign
  invaders such as viruses and bacteria
- type 1 diabetes is generally considered to be an autoimmune
  disorder

** Genetic Counseling
- HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1
