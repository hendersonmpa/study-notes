* Alzheimer disease
** Clinical Characteristics
- characterized by dementia that typically begins with subtle and
  poorly recognized failure of memory and slowly becomes more severe
  and eventually incapacitating
** Diagnostic Testing
- \sim 20 suseptibility genes including APOE e4 allele
- early-onset familial alzheimer disease (EOFAD)
  - pathogenic variants in
** Genetic Counselling
- AD APP PSEN1 PSEN2
* Congenital hearing loss
** Clinical Characteristics
- hearing loss present at birth
** Diagnostic Testing
- congenital CMV infection
- GJB2 at exon 1 and 2
- GJB6 deletions
- DFNB1 
** Genetic Counselling
- GJB2, GJB6, SLC26A4
* Diabetes Mellitus Type I 
** Clinical Characteristics
- very little or no insulin is produced by the pancreas
- progressive \beta cell destruction leads to dysfunction in the
  neighboring \alpha cells which secrete glucagon
  - overproduction of glucagon after meals causes sharper hyperglycemia
  - failure to stimulate glucagon upon incipient hypoglycemia prevents
    a glucagon-mediated rescue of glucose levels
** Diagnostic Testing
- causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, although several risk factors
  have been identified
- the risk of developing type 1 diabetes is increased by certain
  variants of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 genes
- human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex helps the immune system
  distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign
  invaders such as viruses and bacteria
- type 1 diabetes is generally considered to be an autoimmune
  disorder

** Genetic Counselling
- HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1
