* Tuberous sclerosis
** Clinical Characteristics
- TSC involves abnormalities of the:
  - skin :: hypomelanotic macules, confetti skin lesions, facial
            angiofibromas, shagreen patches, fibrous cephalic plaques,
            ungual fibromas
  - brain :: subependymal nodules, cortical dysplasias, and
             subependymal giant cell astrocytomas [SEGAs], seizures,
             intellectual disability / developmental delay,
             psychiatric illness
  - kidney :: angiomyolipomas, cysts, renal cell carcinomas
  - heart :: rhabdomyomas, arrhythmias
  - lungs :: lymphangioleiomyomatosis [LAM], multifocal micronodular
             pneumonocyte hyperplasia.
- CNS tumors are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
- renal disease is the second leading cause of early death.

** Diagnosis
- TSC is established in a proband with one of the following:
  - Two major clinical features
  - One major clinical feature and two or more minor features
  - Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TSC1 or
    TSC2 by molecular genetic testing

** Genetic Counseling
- AD
- Two thirds of affected individuals have TSC as the result of a /de novo/ pathogenic variant.
- The offspring of an affected individual are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant.
- If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family
  member, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk and
  preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

** Pathophysiology
- Tuberin (TSC1) and hamartin (TSC2) are key regulators of the
  AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and to participate in several other
  signaling pathways including the MAPK, AMPK, b-catenin, calmodulin,
  CDK, autophagy, and cell cycle pathways
* Hereditary breast cancer
** Clinical Characteristics
- BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
  syndrome (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and
  male:
  - breast cancer
  - ovarian cancer (includes fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers)
  - to a lesser extent other cancers: prostate cancer, pancreatic
    cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2
    pathogenic variant.
- The exact cancer risks differ slightly depending on whether HBOC is
  caused by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant.
