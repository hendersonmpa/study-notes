* Tuberous Sclerosis
** Clinical Characteristics
- TSC involves abnormalities of the:
  - skin :: hypomelanotic macules, confetti skin lesions, facial
            angiofibromas, shagreen patches, fibrous cephalic plaques,
            ungual fibromas
  - brain :: subependymal nodules, cortical dysplasias, and
             subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), seizures,
             intellectual disability / developmental delay,
             psychiatric illness
  - kidney :: angiomyolipomas, cysts, renal cell carcinomas
  - heart :: rhabdomyomas, arrhythmias
  - lungs :: lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), multifocal micronodular
             pneumonocyte hyperplasia.
- CNS tumors are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
- renal disease is the second leading cause of early death.

** Diagnosis
- TSC is established in a proband with one of the following:
  - two major clinical features
  - one major clinical feature and two or more minor features
  - identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TSC1 or
    TSC2 by molecular genetic testing

** Genetic Counselling
- AD TSC1 TSC2 
- two thirds of affected individuals have TSC as the result of a /de novo/ pathogenic variant

** Pathophysiology
- tuberin (TSC1) and hamartin (TSC2) are key regulators of the
  AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and to participate in several other
  signaling pathways including the MAPK, AMPK, b-catenin, calmodulin,
  CDK, autophagy, and cell cycle pathways

* Hereditary Breast & Ovarian Cancer
** Clinical Characteristics
- BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
  syndrome (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and
  male:
  - breast cancer
  - ovarian cancer includes fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers
  - to a lesser extent other cancers: prostate cancer, pancreatic
    cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2
    pathogenic variant
- the exact cancer risks differ slightly depending on whether HBOC is
  caused by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant
** Diagnosis
- diagnosis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 HBOC is established in a proband by
  identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in
  BRCA1 or BRCA2 on molecular genetic testing

** Genetic Counselling
- germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are inherited in an
  *autosomal dominant* manner
- majority of individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant
  have inherited it from a parent
- \because incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer development,
  cancer risk reduction resulting from prophylactic surgery, or early
  death, not all individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant
  have a parent affected with cancer

** Pathophysiology
- BRCA1 interacts with several proteins involved in cellular pathways,
  including cell-cycle progression, gene transcription regulation, DNA
  damage response, and ubiquitination
- BRCA2 appears to be involved in the DNA repair process
* Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
** Clinical Characteristics
- CML is a cancer of the white blood cells
- a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated
  growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of
  these cells in the blood
- CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a
  proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and
  basophils) and their precursors is found
- a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic
  chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome

** Diagnosis
- CML is often suspected on the basis of a complete blood count
  - increased granulocytes of all types, typically including mature myeloid cells
  - basophils and eosinophils are almost universally increased; this
    feature may help differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction
- bone marrow biopsy is often performed as part of the evaluation for CML
- CML is diagnosed by cytogenetics that detects the translocation
  t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which involves the ABL1 gene in chromosome 9 and
  the BCR gene in chromosome 22
  - \because of this translocation, the chromosome looks smaller than
    its homologue chromosome, and is known as the Philadelphia
    chromosome
  - can be detected by routine cytogenetics
  - BCR-ABL1 fusion can be detected by FISH, as well as by PCR

** Pathophysiology
- chromosomal translocation where parts of two chromosomes (the 9th
  and 22nd) switch places
- part of the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene from chromosome
  22 is fused with the ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9
- abl carries a tyrosine kinase, \therfore the bcr-abl fusion gene
  product is also a tyrosine kinase
- BCR-ABL transcript is continuously active and does not require
  activation by other cellular messaging proteins
  - BCR-ABL activates a cascade of proteins that control the cell
    cycle, speeding up cell division
* Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
** Clinical Characteristics
- FAP is a colon cancer predisposition syndrome in which hundreds to
  thousands of adenomatous colonic polyps develop, beginning, on
  average, at age 16 years (range 7-36 years)
- by age 35 years, 95% of individuals with FAP have polyps
  - *without colectomy colon cancer is inevitable*
- mean age of colon cancer diagnosis in untreated individuals is
  39 years (range 34-43 years)
- extracolonic manifestations are variably present and include:
  - polyps of the gastric fundus and duodenum, osteomas, dental anomalies,
  - congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE)
  - soft tissue tumors, desmoid tumors, and associated cancers

** Diagnosis
- suspected in an individual with suggestive personal and/or family
  history features and confirmed by identification of a heterozygous
  germline pathogenic variant in APC

** Genetic Counselling
- AD APC
- ~75%-80% of individuals with an APC-associated polyposis condition
  have an affected parent
** Pathophysiology
- APC protein product is a tumor suppressor 
- APC appears to prevent accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin and
  maintain normal apoptosis and may also decrease cell proliferation,
  probably through its regulation of beta-catenin
* Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC)
- AKA: Lynch Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cancers of the
  endometrium, stomach, ovary, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract,
  urinary tract, brain, and skin

- individuals with Lynch syndrome the following lifetime risks for
  cancer are seen:
  - CRC :: 52%-82% (mean age at diagnosis 44-61 years)
  - Endometrial cancer in females :: 25%-60% (mean age at diagnosis 48-62 years)
  - Gastric cancer :: 6%-13% (mean age at diagnosis 56 years)
  - Ovarian cancer :: 4%-12% (mean age at diagnosis 42.5 years; ~30%
    are diagnosed < age 40 years)

- risk for other Lynch syndrome-related cancers is lower, though
  substantially increased over general population rates

** Diagnosis
- Lynch syndrome is established in a proband by identification of a
  germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or
  PMS2 or an EPCAM deletion on molecular genetic testing

** Genetic Counselling
- AD MLH1 MSH2 MSH6 PMS2 EPCAM 
- majority of individuals diagnosed with Lynch syndrome have
  inherited the condition from a parent
- because of incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer
  development, cancer risk reduction as a result of screening or
  prophylactic surgery, or early death, not all individuals with a
  pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with Lynch
  syndrome have a parent who had cancer
  
** Pathophysiology
- EPCAM 2p21 :: epithelial cell adhesion molecule
  - recurrent germline deletions of the 3' region result in silencing
    of the adjacent downstream MSH2 by hypermethylation
  - the adjacent MSH2 allele itself is not mutated
  - sequence analysis of EPCAM is not appropriate for diagnosis of
    Lynch syndrome
- MLH1 3p22​.2 :: DNA mismatch repair protein
- MSH2 2p21-p16 :: DNA mismatch repair protein
- MSH6 2p16​.3 :: DNA mismatch repair protein
- PMS2 7p22​.1 :: mismatch repair endonuclease

* Li-Fraumeni Syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- LFS is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with the
  development of the following classic tumors:
  - soft tissue sarcoma
  - osteosarcoma
  - pre-menopausal breast cancer
  - brain tumors
  - adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)
  - leukemias
- a variety of other neoplasms may occur
- LFS-related cancers often occur in childhood or young adulthood and
  survivors have an increased risk for multiple primary cancers

** Diagnosis
- LFS is diagnosed in individuals meeting established clinical
  criteria or in those who have a germline pathogenic variant in TP53
  regardless of family cancer history
- \ge 70% of individuals diagnosed clinically have an identifiable
  germline pathogenic variant in TP53, the only gene so far identified
  in which pathogenic variants are definitively associated with LFS
** Genetic Counselling
- AD TP53
- 7-20% /de novo/ germline TP53 pathogenic variant

** Pathophysiology
- TP53 has been called "the guardian of the genome" and its protein
  plays major roles in both the regulation of cell growth and the
  maintenance of homeostasis
- loss of this important *tumor suppressor gene* decreases the
  likelihood that cells with genetic errors will be flagged for DNA
  repair or apoptosis
- DNA-damaged cells can go on to further proliferate, which can lead
  to a colony of abnormal cells and eventually a malignant tumor

* Retinoblastoma
** Clinical Characteristics
- retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the developing retina that
  occurs in children, usually before age five years
- develops from cells that have cancer-predisposing variants in both
  copies of RB1
- may be unifocal or multifocal
- \sim 60% of affected individuals have unilateral retinoblastoma with
  a mean age of diagnosis of 24 months
- \sim 40% have bilateral retinoblastoma with a mean age of diagnosis
  of 15 months
- individuals with heritable retinoblastoma are also at increased risk
  of developing non-ocular tumors

** Diagnosis
- established by examination of the fundus of the eye using indirect
  ophthalmoscopy
- imaging studies can be used to support the diagnosis and stage the tumor
- diagnosis of heritable retinoblastoma is established in a proband
  with:
  - retinoblastoma or retinoma and a family history of retinoblastoma or
  - identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in RB1

- the following staging has been recommended for individuals with
  retinoblastoma and/or risk of heritable retinoblastoma to include
  "H" to describe the genetic risk for an individual to have a
  germline pathogenic variant in RB1:

  - HX :: unknown or insufficient evidence of a constitutional
          (germline) RB1 pathogenic variant

  - H0 :: normal RB1 alleles in blood tested with demonstrated
          high-sensitivity assays

  - H0* :: normal RB1 in blood with <1% residual risk for mosaicism

  - H1 :: bilateral retinoblastoma, trilateral retinoblastoma
          (retinoblastoma with intracranial CNS midline embryonic
          tumor), family history of retinoblastoma, or RB1 pathogenic
          variant identified in blood

** Genetic Counselling
- AD RB1
- individuals with heritable retinoblastoma have a heterozygous /de
  novo/ or inherited germline RB1 pathogenic variant
- susceptibility is AD mode of action similar to AR
  - inheritance of a single mutant allele "first hit" 
  - a somatic mutation "second hit" is required
** Pathophysiology
- RB1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that is
  involved in cell cycle regulation (G1 to S transition)
