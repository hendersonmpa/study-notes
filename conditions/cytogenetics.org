* Cri du chat syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- AKA 5p- (5p minus) syndrome
- infants often have a high-pitched cry that sounds like that of a
  cat
- characterized by intellectual disability and delayed development,
  microcephaly, low birth weight, hypotonia
- distinctive facial features, including widely set eyes
  (hypertelorism), low-set ears, a small jaw, and a rounded face.
- some born with a heart defect

** Diagnostic Testing
- CMA, karyotype for a 5p deletion
- size of the deletion varies among affected individuals
- larger deletions \to more severe intellectual disability and
  developmental delay than smaller deletions

** Genetic Counseling
- most cases are not inherited, result of a /de novo/ deletion
- ~ 10 percent of people with cri-du-chat syndrome inherit the
  chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent with a balanced translocation
* Pallister-Killian syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- hypotonia in infancy and early childhood
- intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, sparse hair,
  areas of unusual pigmentation, and other birth defects

** Diagnostic Testing
- CMA, karyotype for mosaic isochromosome 12p (i(12p))

** Genetic Counseling
- not inherited

* Triploidy
** Clinical Characteristics
Triploidy can result from either two sperm fertilizing one egg
(polyspermy) (60%) or from one sperm fertilizing an egg with two
copies of every chromosome (40%)

- Many organ systems are affected by triploidy, but the central
  nervous system and skeleton are the most severely affected:
  - holoprosencephaly, hydrocephalus, ventriculomegaly, Arnoldâ€“Chiari
    malformation, agenesis of the corpus callosum and neural tube
    defects
- Skeletal manifestations include cleft lip/palate, hypertelorism,
  club foot and syndactyly of fingers three and four
- Congenital heart defects, hydronephrosis, omphalocele and
  meningocele (spina bifida) are also common
- IUGR

** Diagnostic Testing
- \uparrow AFP
- RAD, karyotype
** Genetic Counseling
- not inherited
* TODO Trisomy 13
* TODO Trisomy 18
* TODO Trisomy 21
* Klinefelter syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- boys and men, affects physical and intellectual development
- taller than average and infertile
- signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome vary among boys and men with this condition
- reduced testosterone 
** Diagnostic Testing
- 47,XXY karyotype
- mosaic Klinefelter syndrome 46,XY/47,XXY

** Genetic Counseling
- not inherited
* Fanconi anemia
** Clinical Characteristics
- physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and increased risk for
  malignancy
- physical abnormalities, present in approximately 75% of affected individuals, include one or more of the following:
  - short stature, abnormal skin pigmentation, skeletal malformations
    of the upper and lower limbs, microcephaly, and ophthalmic and
    genitourinary tract anomalies

** Diagnostic Testing
- established in a proband with increased chromosome breakage and
  radial forms on cytogenetic testing of lymphocytes with
  diepoxybutane (DEB) and mitomycin C (MMC)

- diagnosis is confirmed by identification of one of the following:
  - biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the 19 genes known to
    cause autosomal recessive FA
  - heterozygous pathogenic variant in RAD51, known to cause autosomal dominant FA
  - hemizygous pathogenic variant in FANCB, known to cause X-linked FA

** Genetic Counseling
- AR, AD (RAD51) or X-linked (FANCB)

* Ataxia-telangiectasia
** Clinical Characteristics
- progressive cerebellar ataxia beginning between ages one and four
  years, oculomotor apraxia, choreoathetosis, telangiectasias of the
  conjunctivae, immunodeficiency, frequent infections, and an
  increased risk for malignancy, particularly leukemia and lymphoma
** Diagnostic Testing
- diagnosis is established by the presence of biallelic (homozygous or
  compound heterozygous) ATM pathogenic variants or (when available)
  by immunoblotting to test for absent or reduced ATM protein

** Genetic Counseling
- AR, ATM
* Williams syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- cardiovascular disease :elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary
  stenosis, supravalvar aortic stenosis, hypertension
- distinctive facies, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual
  disability (usually mild)
- a specific cognitive profile, unique personality characteristics
- growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia,
  hypercalciuria, hypothyroidism, and early puberty)
- hypotonia and hyperextensible joints can result in delayed
  attainment of motor milestones

** Diagnostic Testing
- clinical diagnostic criteria
- diagnosis requires detection of a recurrent 7q11.23 contiguous gene deletion of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR) that encompasses the elastin gene (ELN)
  - can be detected using FISH and/or deletion/duplication testing
** Genetic Counseling
- AD
- most /de novo/

* 22q11 deletion syndrome
** Clinical Characteristics
- a contiguous gene deletion syndrome
- included phenotypes:
  - DiGeorge syndrome
  - Velocardiofacial syndrome
  - Conotruncal anomaly face syndrome
  - Autosomal dominant Opitz G/BBB syndrome
  - Sedlackova syndrome
  - Cayler cardiofacial syndrome

- congenital heart disease (74%)
  - tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch, ventricular septal defect, and truncus arteriosus
- palatal abnormalities (69%)
  - velopharyngeal incompetence, submucosal cleft palate, bifid uvula, and cleft palate
- facial features (majority of northern European)
- learning difficulties (70%-90%)
- immune deficiency (77%)

** Diagnostic Testing
- submicroscopic deletion of chromosome 22 by FISH, MLPA, CMA

** Genetic Counseling
- AD
- ~ 93% /de novo/ deletion of 22q11.2
- ~ 7% inherited the 22q11.2 deletion
