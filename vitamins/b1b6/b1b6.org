* Thiamine
- thiamine (vitamin B_1) is water soluble
- transported across cell membranes by THTR1 and THTR2
  - encoded by the SLC19A2 and SLC19A3
- both are widely expressed in the body
- differ in kinetic properties and level of expression in different tissues
- THTR2 is the major transporter in the upper small intestine where
  dietary thiamine is absorbed at the luminal surface
- THTR1 predominates at the basal surface
- active cofactor of thiamine, TPP, is formed in the cytoplasm by the
  enzyme thiamine pyrophosphokinase
- TPP cofactor is attached directly to the transketolase and 2-hydroxyacyl CoA lyase apoproteins
- a TPP transporter (MTPPT) in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  delivers the cofactor to the \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases in the
  mitochondrial matrix

** Defective Transport
- THTR1 or 2 deficiency
** TPP biosynthesis 
- Thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK1) deficiency
- \uparrow blood and CSF lactate
- \uparrow urine \alpha-ketoglutarate
- \downarrow TPP
** Mitochondrial transport 
- mitochondrial TPP transporter deficiency - amish lethal microcephaly
- \uparrow urine \alpha-ketoglutarate
** Binding to apo-enzyme
- PDHC
  - \uparrow lactate
  - normal L/P ratio
- BCKAD
  - \uparrow BCAAs

* Pyridoxine
- pyridoxine (vitamin B_6) is water soluble
- broad availability from various food sources
- three vitamers and their phosphorylated esters are absorbed in the
  small intestine:
  1) pyridoxal
  2) pyridoxamine
  3) pyridoxine

- phosphorylated forms undergo dephosphorylation for cellular uptake
  by tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSAP)
  - transport mechanism of B_6 vitamers across cell membranes not
    elucidated
- within cells vitamers are rephosphorylated by kinases and further oxidised to the
  active cofactor pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) by pyridox(am)ine
  5’-phosphate oxidase(PNPO)
- liver seems to be the most important organ of PLP formation
  - PNPO is expressed in various cell types including neurons
- PLP is one of the most abundant cofactors and participates in over
  140 reactions in amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism
- systemic vitamin B_6 deficiency causes seizures, failure to thrive
  and anemia
- nutritional vitamin B_6 deficiency is rarely seen
  - usually occurs together with other vitamin deficiencies in
    malnutrition or in association with severe chronic disease

- several mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for
  pyridoxine and/or PLP:
  1. inborn errors affecting the pathways of B_6 vitamer metabolism
     - PNPO and alkaline phosphatase defects
  2. inborn errors that lead to accumulation of small molecules that
     react with PLP and inactivate it
     - hyperprolinemia type II
     - antiquitin deficiency (pyridoxine dependent epilepsy)
  3. inborn errors affecting specific PLP dependent enzymes
     - X-linked sideroblastic anemia
     - classical homocystinuria
     - gyrate atrophy of the choroid
  4. drugs as D-penicillamine or isozianid thataffect the metabolism of
     B 6 vitamers or react with PLP
  5. coeliac disease(malabsorption) or renal dialysis(loss)
- inborn errors of metabolism \to \downarrow PLP
  - by inactivation, reduced formation, or reduced cellular uptake of PLP
  - all autosomal recessive
  - seizures are a hallmark of the disease
    - no or incomplete response to common anticonvulsants
    - good response to pyridoxine or PLP

** Antiquitin deficiency
- presents in neonates with myoclonic and tonic seizures or
  status epilepticus
- onset up to 3 years observed
- antiquitin (ALDH7A1) encodes for \alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  - involved in lysine degradation
  - deficiency results in \uparrow \alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde (AASA)
    - AASA is in equilibrium with piperideine-6-carboxylate (PC6)
    - PC6 inactivates PLP
- simultaneous determination of sulfocysteine is crucial to exclude
  molybdenum cofactor and sulfite oxidase deficiency causing secondary
  inhibition of antiquitin
- most common form of pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE)
- \uparrow urine AASA (\alpha-aminoadipic acid)
- \uparrow urine P6C (piperideine-6-carboxylate)
- \uparrow urine P5C (pyroline-5-carboxylate)
- pipecolic acid in plasma, the first described biomarker of PDE, is
  less specific as it can also be found in peroxisomal disease and has
  been found normal in older patients while on pyridoxine
- treated with pyridoxine

** Hyperprolinemia Type II
- attenuated phenotype
- ~ 50% present with seizures
- \uparrow inactivating compound P5C due to deficiency of pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase
- \Uparrow plasma proline
- \uparrow urine P5C

** PNPO deficiency
- clinically indistinguishable from antiquitin deficiency
- severe (systemic) PLP deficiency and impaired function of PLP
  dependent enzymes
- \uparrow urine vanillactate
- \uparrow pyridoxamine
- \uparrow pyridoxamine/pyridoxic acids
- treat with oral PLP

** Congenital Hypophosphatasia
- severe form \to neonatal seizures
- osteomalacia
- Tissue Non Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (TNSAP) deficiency
  - impaired dephosphorylation of PLP for cellular uptake
- \Downarrow plasma alkaline phosphatase
- \uparrow serum calcium
- \downarrow serum phosphate
- \uparrow plasma phosphoethanolamine
