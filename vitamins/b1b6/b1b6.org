* Thiamine
- thiamine (vitamin B_1) is water soluble
- transported across cell membranes by THTR1 and THTR2
  - encoded by the SLC19A2 and SLC19A3
- both are widely expressed in the body
- differ in kinetic properties and level of expression in different tissues
- THTR2 is the major transporter in the upper small intestine where
  dietary thiamine is absorbed at the luminal surface
- THTR1 predominates at the basal surface
- cofactor thiamine pyrophospate (TPP) is formed in the cytoplasm by
  the enzyme thiamine pyrophosphokinase
  - mitochondrial TPP transporter (MTPPT) in the inner mitochondrial membrane
    delivers the cofactor to the \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases in the
    mitochondrial matrix
    - PDH, KGDH and BCKDH
- TPP cofactor is attached directly to the transketolase and 2-hydroxyacyl CoA lyase apoproteins

** Defective Transport
- THTR1 or 2 deficiency
** TPP biosynthesis 
- *thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK1)* deficiency
- \uparrow blood and CSF lactate
- \uparrow urine \alpha-ketoglutarate
- \downarrow TPP
** Mitochondrial transport 
- *mitochondrial TPP transporter (MTTPT)* deficiency - amish lethal
  microcephaly
- \uparrow urine \alpha-ketoglutarate
** Binding to Apo-Enzymes
- PDH and KGDH
  - \uparrow lactate
  - normal L/P ratio
- BCKDH
  - \uparrow BCAAs

* Pyridoxine
- pyridoxine (vitamin B_6) is water soluble
- broad availability from various food sources
- three vitamers and their phosphorylated esters are absorbed in the
  small intestine:
  1) pyridoxal - aldehyde group
  2) pyridoxamine - amine group
  3) pyridoxine - hydroxyl group

- phosphorylated forms undergo dephosphorylation by tissue
  non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSAP) prior to cellular uptake
    - transport mechanism of B_6 vitamers across cell membranes not
      elucidated
- within cells vitamers are rephosphorylated by kinases and further oxidised to the
  active cofactor pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) by pyridox(am)ine
  5’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO)
- liver seems to be the most important organ of PLP formation
  - PNPO is expressed in various cell types including neurons
- PLP is one of the most abundant cofactors and participates in over
  140 reactions in amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism
- functions include:
  - neurotransmitter biosynthesis
    - serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, GABA
  - amino acids metabolism
    - proline, transamination (i.e. alanine), serine, tryptophan
  - glucose metabolism
    - transamination of glycogenic amino acids
    - glycogenolysis - glycogen phosphorylase
  - lipid metabolism
  - heme synthesis - ALA synthase
- systemic vitamin B_6 deficiency causes seizures, failure to thrive
  and anemia
- nutritional vitamin B_6 deficiency is rarely seen
  - usually occurs together with other vitamin deficiencies in
    malnutrition or in association with severe chronic disease

- several mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for
  pyridoxine and/or PLP:
  1. IEMs affecting the pathways of B_6 vitamer metabolism
     - PNPO and alkaline phosphatase defects
  2. IEMs that lead to accumulation of small molecules that
     react with PLP and sequester it
     - P5CDH deficiency (hyperprolinemia type II)
     - antiquitin deficiency (pyridoxine dependent epilepsy)
  3. IEMs affecting specific PLP dependent enzymes
     - ALAS deficiency (X-linked sideroblastic anemia)
     - CBS deficiency (classical homocystinuria)
     - OAT deficiency (gyrate atrophy of the choroid retina)
  4. drugs that affect the metabolism of B_6 vitamers or react with PLP
     - D-penicillamine and isozianid
  5. coeliac disease (malabsorption) or renal dialysis (loss)
- IEMs \to \downarrow PLP
  - via inactivation, reduced formation, or reduced cellular uptake of
    PLP
  - all autosomal recessive
  - seizures are a hallmark of the disease
    - no or incomplete response to common anticonvulsants
    - good response to pyridoxine or PLP

** Antiquitin deficiency
- AKA: pyridoxine responsive seizures
- presents in neonates with myoclonic and tonic seizures or
  status epilepticus
- onset up to 3 years observed
- antiquitin (ALDH7A1) encodes *\alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase*
  - involved in lysine degradation (Figure [[fig:lysine]])
\ce{AASA ->[antiquitin] AAA}
  - deficiency results in \uparrow \alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde (AASA)
    - AASA is in equilibrium with piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C)
    - P6C inactivates PLP
- *simultaneous determination of S-sulfocysteine is crucial to exclude*
  *molybdenum cofactor and sulfite oxidase deficiency causing secondary*
  *inhibition of antiquitin*
  - \uparrow S-sulfocysteine inhibits antiquitin
- most common form of pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE)
- \uparrow urine AASA (\alpha-aminoadipic acid)
- \uparrow urine P6C (piperideine-6-carboxylate)
- \uparrow pipecolic acid in plasma, the first described biomarker of PDE
  - less specific as it can also be found in peroxisomal disease
- treat with pyridoxine
