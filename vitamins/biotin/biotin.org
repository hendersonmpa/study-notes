* Introduction
- biotin is a water-soluble vitamin widely present in small amounts in
  natural food-stuffs, in which it is mostly protein bound
- classic role of biotin is to function as the coenzyme of five
  important carboxylases involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid
  synthesis and the catabolism of several amino acids
- covalent binding of biotin to the inactive apocarboxylases,
  catalysed by holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS), is required to
  generate the active holocarboxylases
- recycling of biotin first involves proteolytic degradation of the
  holocarboxylases, yielding biotin bound to lysine (biocytin) or to
  short biotinyl peptides
- biotinidase releases biotin 
- transcription of a large number of genes, including those encoding
  HCS and the biotin-dependent carboxylases , is regulated by biotin
  in a process that requires biotinyl-5â€™-AMP, the intermediate of the
  HCS reaction
- SLC19A3 encoding the thiamine transporter hTHTR2, mutations cause
  biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease

- two inherited defects affecting the coenzyme function of biotin:
  1) holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) deficiency
  2) biotinidase deficiency
- both lead to deficiency of all biotin-dependent carboxylases
  - multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD)
- HCS deficiency \to impaired binding of biotin to apocarboxylases
- biotinidase deficiency \to biotin depletion

** Clinical Presentation
- the carboxylases play an essential role in:
  - the catabolism of several amino acids
  - gluconeogenesis
  - fatty-acid synthesis
- deficiency provokes multiple, life-threatening metabolic
  derangements
  - characteristic organic aciduria, neurological symptoms and skin
    disease
- patients with HCS deficiency commonly present with typical MCD
- patients with biotinidase deficiency show a less consistent clinical
  picture
- onset in biotinidase deficiency may be insidious and the
  manifestation is usually very variable
  - neurological symptoms often being prominent
  - without markedly abnormal organic acid excretion or metabolic
    acidosis
- Later-onset forms of HCS deficiency cannot be clinically
  distinguished from biotinidase deficiency

- characteristic symptoms include:
  - metabolicacidosis, hypotonia, seizures, ataxia, impaired
    consciousness and cutaneous symptoms, such as skin rash and
    alopecia.
- all patients with biotinidase and a majority of patients with HCS
  deficiency respond dramatically to oral therapy with pharmacological
  doses of biotin
- delayed diagnosis and treatment in biotinidase deficiency may result
  in irreversible neurological damage
- a few patients with HCS deficiency show only a partial or even no
  response to biotin and seem to have an impaired long-term
  outcome.
- acquired biotin deficiency, which also causes MCD, is extremely rare
