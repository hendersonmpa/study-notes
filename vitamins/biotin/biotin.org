* Introduction
- biotin is a water-soluble vitamin widely present in small amounts in
  natural food-stuffs, in which it is mostly protein bound
- classic role of biotin is to function as the coenzyme of five
  important carboxylases involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid
  synthesis and the catabolism of several amino acids
- covalent binding of biotin to the inactive apocarboxylases,
  catalysed by holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS), is required to
  generate the active holocarboxylases
- recycling of biotin first involves proteolytic degradation of the
  holocarboxylases, yielding biotin bound to lysine (biocytin) or to
  short biotinyl peptides
- biotinidase releases biotin 
- transcription of a large number of genes, including those encoding
  HCS and the biotin-dependent carboxylases , is regulated by biotin
- SLC19A3 encoding the thiamine transporter hTHTR2, mutations cause
  biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease

* Biotin-responsive disorders
- two inherited defects affecting the coenzyme function of biotin:
  1) holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) deficiency
  2) biotinidase deficiency
- HCS deficiency \to impaired binding of biotin to apocarboxylases
- biotinidase deficiency \to biotin depletion
- both lead to multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD) a deficiency of
  all biotin-dependent carboxylases:
  1) acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)
  2) propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC)
  3) 3-methylcrotonyl carboxylase (MCC)
  4) pyruvate carboxylase (PC)
  5) urea carboxylase (UC)

** Clinical Presentation
- patients with HCS deficiency commonly present with typical MCD
  - organic aciduria, neurological symptoms and skin
    disease
- patients with biotinidase deficiency show a less consistent clinical
  picture
- onset in biotinidase deficiency may be insidious and the
  manifestation is usually very variable
  - neurological symptoms often being prominent
  - without markedly abnormal organic acid excretion or metabolic
    acidosis
- later-onset forms of HCS deficiency cannot be clinically
  distinguished from biotinidase deficiency

- acquired biotin deficiency, which also causes MCD, is extremely rare
  - excessive consumption of raw eggs - avidin

- deficient activity of biotin-dependent carboxylases in both HCS and
  biotinidase deficiencies results in accumulation of:
  - lactic acid
  - derivatives of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA
  - derivatives of propionyl-CoA

*** HCS Deficiency
- age of onset varies widely, from a few hours after birth to 8 years
  of age
- \sim 50% presented acutely in the first days of life with symptoms
  similar to other severe organic acidurias
  - lethargy, hypotonia, vomiting, seizures and hypothermia
- infection \to catabolism \to acute illness

*** Biotinidase Deficiency
- gradual development of symptoms and episodes of remission
  - remission may be related to increased free biotin in the diet
- clinical picture has been reported as early as 7 weeks
- neurological symptoms may occur much earlier, even in neonatal period:
  - lethargy, muscular hypotonia, grand mal and myoclonic seizures, ataxia
- many children also have developmental delay, hearing loss,
  conjunctivitis and visual problems, including optic atrophy
- skin rash and/or alopecia are hallmarks but may develop late or not
  at all
- metabolic acidosis and the characteristic organic aciduria of MCD
  often absent in the early stages of the disease
  - plasma lactate and 3-hydroxyisovalerate may be only slightly
    elevated
  - CSF levels may be significantly higher

** Metabolic Derangement
*** HCS Deficiency
- decreased affinity of the enzyme for biotin and/or a decreased
  maximal velocity lead to reduced formation of the five
  holocarboxylases from their corresponding inactive apocarboxylases
  at physiological biotin concentrations
- increased Km for Biotin
  - normally 1-6 nmol/L, patients 9-12 nmol/L
- abnormality of the K_M values correlates well with the time of onset
  and severity of illness
  - \uparrow K_M \to early onset, severe disease

- mutations outside the biotin-binding site in the N-terminal region
  are associated with virtually normal K_M but decreased V_{max}
  - most patients with V_{max} mutation respond to a higher biotin
    dose and residual biochemical and clinical abnormalities persist
  - response likely due to \uparrow HLCS mRNA transcription

*** Biotinidase deficiency
 - biotin cannot be released from biocytin and short biotinyl
   peptides
   - unable to recycle endogenous biotin and use protein-bound dietary biotin
 - biotin is lost in the urine, mainly as biocytin

** Genetics
- HCS :: AR , HLCS
- Biotinidase :: AR, BTD
  - one-third of the alleles, are c.98-104del7ins3 and p.R538C
  - ~ 50% NBS positive are p.Q456H, the double-mutant allele p.A171T +
    p.D444H, and p.D252G
  - almost all individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency have
    the p.D444H mutation in combination with a mutation causing
    profound biotinidase deficiency on the second allele

** Diagnostic Tests
- A characteristic organic aciduria is the key feature of MCD.
- unpleasant urine odour (catâ€™s urine) may even be suggestive of the
  defect
- MCD is reflected in elevated urinary and plasma concentrations of
  organic acids as follows:
  - Deficiency of MCC:
    - \Uparrow urine 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid
    - \Uparrow plasma 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5-OH)
    - \uparrow urine 3-methylcrotonylglycine
    - \uparrow plasma tiglylcarnitine (C5:1)
  - Deficiency of PCC:
    - \uparrow urine methylcitrate
    - \uparrow urine 3-hydroxypropionate
    - \uparrow urine propionylglycine
    - \uparrow urine tiglylglycine
    - \uparrow urine propionic acid
    - \uparrow plasma propionylcarnitine (C3)
  - Deficiency of PC:
    - \Uparrow lactate
    - \downarrow pyruvate
- above pattern seen in HCS during acute illness
- *NB* a similar organic acid profile can occur in patients with
  hyperammonemia due to carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency


- biotindase deficiency often only \uparrow urine 3-hydroxyisovalerate
- \downarrow biotinidase activity in serum
- confirm with molecular testing 

*** Biotinidase Activity
- most symptomatic children with biotinidase deficiency were found to
  have 3% of mean serum biotinidase activity of normal individuals
  - profound deficiency :: \lt 10% of mean normal activity
  - partial deficinecy :: 10-30% of mean normal activity

** Treatment and Prognosis
- oral biotin, at pharmacological dose
- initiate treatment prior to irreversible neurological damage
  - deafness
- treatment of partial biotinidase deficiency is recommended
