* Cobalamin
- cobalamin (Cbl or vitamin B_{12}) is a cobalt-containing
  water-soluble vitamin that is synthesised by lower organisms but not
  by higher plants and animals
- only source of Cbl in the human diet is animal products
- Cbl is needed for only two reactions
  1. MeCbl it is a cofactor of the cytoplasmic enzyme methionine synthase (MTR)
     - \ce{HCY + MeCbl + methyl-THF ->[MTR] MET + B_12 + THF}
  2. AdoCbl is a cofactor of the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase (MUT)
     - \ce{methylmalonyl-CoA ->[MUT + AdoCbl] succinyl-CoA}
- Cbl metabolism involves complex absorption and transport systems and
  multiple intracellular conversions

- serum Cbl level is usually low in patients with disorders affecting
  absorption and transport of Cbl
  - with the exception of transcobalamin (TC) deficiency
- patients with disorders of intracellular Cbl metabolism typically
  have serum Cbl levels within the reference range
  - levels may be reduced in the cblF and cblJ disorders
- disorders of Cbl absorption, transport and MeCbl synthesis result in:
  - homocystinuria, hyperhomocysteinaemia
  - megaloblastic anaemia
  - neurological disorders
- disorders of AdoCbl synthesis result in:
  - methylmalonic aciduria and acidemia (MMA) \to metabolic
    acidosis
- \uparrow urine MMA and plasma HCY are also found in nutritional
  vitamin B_{12} deficiency
- severe vitamin B_{12} deficiency in newborn infants can occur in
  breast fed infants born to vegan mothers or those with sub-clinical
  pernicious anaemia can range from:
  - elevation in serum concentration of propionylcarnitine detected by
    newborn screening
  - severe neonatal encephalopathy
- mother does not necessarily have a very low serum concentration of
  vitamin B_{12}
- IM vitamin B_{12} replacement therapy to normalize vitamin B_{12} serum
  concentration reverses the metabolic abnormality

** Absorption and Transport
- absorption of dietary Cbl first involves binding to a glyco protein
  (haptocorrin, R binder) in the saliva
- haptocorrin is digested by proteases in the intestine
  - releases Cbl to bind to intrinsic factor (IF)
- IF-Cbl binds to receptor cubam and enters the enterocyte
- Cbl enters the portal circulation bound to transcobalamin (TC)
  - TC is the physiologically important circulating Cbl-binding
    protein
- inherited defects of several of these steps are known
  - Hereditary Intrinsic Factor Deficiency
  - Defective Transport of Cobalamin by Enterocytes
  - Haptocorrin (R Binder) Deficiency
  - Transcobalamin Deficiency
  - Transcobalamin Receptor Deficiency
- all are rare
** Cbl mutants (A-G, J, X)
- a number of disorders of intracellular metabolism of Cbl have been
  classified as cbl mutants (A-G, J, X)
  - based on the biochemical phenotype and somatic cell analysis
- precise diagnosis of the inborn errors of Cbl metabolism requires
  either tests in cultured fibroblasts or identification of causal
  mutations
- complementation analysis can be used to reliably assign a patient to
  one of the known classes of inborn error if function of either
  methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) mutase or methionine synthase is
  reduced in patient fibroblasts
- the one exception is the cblX disorder which cannot be
  differentiated from cblC by complementation analysis
** Combined AdoCbl and MeCbl Deficiencies
- /cblF, cblJ, cblC, cblX, CblD/
  - F, J, D and X are very rare
** Cobalamin C
*** Clinical Presentation
- most frequent inborn error of Cbl metabolism
- many acutely ill in the 1st month of life
- most were diagnosed within the 1st year
- early-onset group shows feeding difficulties and lethargy
  - followed by progressive neurological deterioration may include: 
    - hypotonia, hypertonia or both, abnormal movements or seizures
      and coma
  - severe pancytopenia or a non-regenerative anaemia may be present
    - megaloblastic on bone marrow examination
- a small number of cblC patients diagnosed \gt 1st year of life
  - as late as 4th decade

*** Metabolic Derangement
- /cblC/ is caused by defects in MMACHC
- MMACHC binds Cbl and catalyses removal of upper axial ligands from
  alkylcobalamins including the methyl group from MeCbl and the
  adenosyl group from AdoCbl and from CNCbl

*** Genetics
- AR, MMACHC

*** Diagnostic Tests
- methylmalonic acidaemia and aciduria are the
  biochemical hallmarks of this disease
  - MMA \lt MUT deficiency
  - MMA \gt transport defects
- \uparrow plasma total homocysteine
- \downarrow to normal plasma methionine
- \uparrow urine HCY

*** Treatment
- parenteral OHCbl
- oral betaine (trimethylglycine)
- betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) is betaine dependent
\ce{trimethylglycine + homocysteine ->[BHMT] dimethylglycine + methionine}
- in the liver BHMT catalyzes up to 50% of homocysteine metabolism
- betaine treatment \to \uparrow sarcosine (methlyglycine) in plasma amino acids

** Cobalamin X
- /cblX/ is caused by mutations in HCFC1
- same phenotype as /cblC/
  - encodes a transcription regulator that affects expression of a
    number of genes, including MMACHC (/cblC/)
- metabolic consequences of mutations stem from decreased MMACHC
  expression leading to decreased synthesis of both AdoCbl and MeCbl

** Adenosylcobalamin Deficiency
- /cblA and cblB/
- characterised by methylmalonic aciduria (MMA)
- often Cbl-responsive
- phenotype resembles methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency
- treated with protein restriction and OHCbl

** Methylcobalamin Deficiency
- /cblE and cblG/
- megaloblastic anaemia and neurological disease
* Folate
- folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) is plentiful in foods such as
  liver, leafy vegetables, legumes and some fruits
- metabolism involves reduction to dihydrofolate (DHF) and
  tetrahydrofolate (THF)
  - followed by addition of a single-carbon unit, which is provided by
    serine or histidine; this carbon unit occurs in various redox
    states
    - methyl, methylene, methenyl or formyl
- transfer of this single-carbon unit is essential for the endogenous
  formation of:
  - methionine (methionine synthase)
  - thymidylate (dTMP)
  - formylglycineamide ribotide (FGAR) and
    formylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (FAICAR) two
    intermediates of purine synthesis
- these reactions regenerate DHF and THF
- the predominant folate derivative in blood and in cerebrospinal
  fluid is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  - product of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rxn
- there are a number of very rare disorders of folate absorption and metabolism
- severe MTHFR deficiency is the most frequent

** Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase Deficiency
- severe form of this deficiency not the polymorphisms associated
  common disease risk
  - neural tube defects
  - cardiovascular disease
*** Clinical Presentation
- most diagnosed in infancy
- \gt 50% present in the 1st year of life
- common presentation is progressive encephalopathy with apnoea,
  seizures and microcephaly
- not associated with megaloblastic anaemia

*** Metabolic Derangement
- \downarrow methyl-THF 
- methyl-THF is the methyl donor for the conversion of homocysteine
  \to methionine by methionine synthase
  - \uparrow total plasma homocysteine
  - \downarrow methionine
- the block in the conversion of methylene-THF to methyl-THF does not
  result in the trapping of folates as methyl-THF
  - \therefore does not \downarrow reduced folates for purine and
    pyrimidine synthesis
  - contrast to disorders at the level of methionine synthase
  - explains why patients do not have megaloblastic anaemia

*** Genetics
- AR, MTHFR

*** Diagnostic Tests
- methyl-THF is the major circulating form of folate
  - \therefore serum folate levels may sometimes be low
- \Uparrow plasma homocysteine
- \downarrow plasma methionine

*** Treatment
- oral betaine (trimethylglycine)
- betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) is betaine dependent
\ce{trimethylglycine + homocysteine ->[BHMT] dimethylglycine + methionine}
- in the liver BHMT catalyzes up to 50% of homocysteine metabolism
- betaine treatment \to \uparrow sarcosine (methlyglycine) in plasma amino acids
