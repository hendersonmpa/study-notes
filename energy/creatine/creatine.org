* Introduction
- creatine is synthesized by two enzymatic reactions:
  1) arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) catalyses the
     transfer of an amidino group from arginine to glycine, yielding
     guanidinoacetate
  2) guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) catalyses the
     methylation of the amidino group in the guanidinoacetate
     molecule, yielding creatine

- creatine synthesis occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in the kidney
  and in the pancreas, which have high AGAT activity, and in the
  liver, which has high GAMT activity

- from these organs of synthesis creatine is transported via the
  bloodstream to the organs of utilization, mainly muscle and brain
  - taken up by a sodium and chloride dependent Creatine Transporter
    (CRTR)

- most brain creatine is transported from the blood via CRTR expressed
  at blood-brain barrier
- a minor proportion is synthesized in the brain

- part of intracellular creatine is reversibly converted into the
  high-energy compound creatine-phosphate by creatine kinase (CK)

- creatine and creatine-phosphate are non-enzymatically converted into
  creatinine

- creatinine is mainly excreted in urine and its daily excretion is
  directly proportional to total body creatine, and in particular to
  muscle mass

* Creatine Deficiency Syndromes
- creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) are a group of inborn errors of:
- creatine synthesis
  - *arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT)* deficiency
  - *guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT)* deficiency
- creatine transport
  - X-linked *creatine transporter (CRTR)* deficiency
- global developmental delay/ intellectual disability along with
  various neurological manifestations

- secondary changes in creatine metabolism have been described in
  disorders affecting arginine, ornithine and methionine metabolism including:
  - ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) deficiency
  - urea cycle defects
  - hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome
  - \Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) deficiency
  - methylcobalamin synthesis defects
  - mitochondrial disease

** Clinical Presentation
- global developmental delay (GDD) / intellectual disability (ID)
  - with prominent speech delay
- GDD or ID ranges from mild to severe and is characteristically
  associated with challenging (hyperactive, autistic) behaviours
- distinguishing symptoms:
  - AGAT :: myopathy
  - GAMT :: movement disorders and basal ganglia changes are
            additional features
  - GAMT & CRTR :: epilepsy

** Metabolic Derangement
- cerebral creatine deficiency is caused by reduced synthesis of
  creatine in AGAT and GAMT deficiency or by impaired uptake into the
  brain in CRTR deficiency
- low intracellular creatine and creatine-phosphate result in reduced
  production of creatinine
  - \therefore \low urine and plasma creatinine
- guanidinoacetate is neurotoxic \to CNS
  - \downarrow AGAT deficiency
  - \uparrow GAMT deficiency

** Genetics
- AR, AGAT (GATM) and GAMT (GAMT)
- X-linked, CRTC (SLC6A8)
** Diagnostic Tests
- MRS to screen for cerebral creatine deficiency
- urine guanidinoacetate, creatine and creatinine is an important
  screening test for all CDS (Table [[tab:cdsurine]])
- CSF guanidinoacetate
  - \uparrow GAMT, 100x normal

#+NAME: tab:cdsurine
|      | GAA        | creatine/creatinine |
|------+------------+---------------------|
| AGAT | \downarrow | n/\downarrow        |
| GAMT | \uparrow   | \downarrow          |
| CRTR | n          | \uparrow            |

** Treatment
- normal neurodevelopmental outcome has been reported in early treated
  patients with creatine synthesis defects
- AGAT and GAMT treated with creatine monohydrate
- GAMT deficiency - reduction of guanidinoacetate is achieved by
  ornithine supplementation \pm dietary arginine restriction
- CRTC no treatment
- CRTR deficiency - creatine, arginine and glycine supplementation
  does not significantly improve outcome, although partial clinical
  improvement has been reported in single patients
