#+TITLE: Disorders of the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- pathways for oxidation of fatty acids, glucose, amino acids and
  ketones produce acetyl-CoA which can enter the TCA cycle
- one molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate
- pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA which is the main TCA input
- release of energy via oxidation of acetly-CoA
- primary function of the TCA cycle is to generate reducing
  equivalents in the form of NADH and FADH_2
  - used to produce ATP in the electron transport chain

** Disorders of the TCA cycle

- \alpha-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
- Succinate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- Fumarase Deficiency

* \alpha-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
- KDHC is a \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase analogous to PDHC and BCKD

\ce{\alpha-ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA ->[KDHC] succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH}

#+CAPTION[]:\alpha-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex
#+NAME: tab:kd
| Unit | Name                               | Gene | Cofactor               |
|------+------------------------------------+------+------------------------|
| E1   | \alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase | OGDH | thiamine pyrophosphate |
| E2   | dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase  | DLST | lipoic acid, CoA       |
| E3   | dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase        | DLD  | FAD, NAD^{+}           |

- E1 subunit is the thiamine dependant substrate specific dehydrogenase
  - not regulated by phosphorylation
- E2 subunit dihydrolipyoyl succinyl-transferase is also specific to KDHC

** Clinical Presentation
- similar to PDHC (section [[Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency]])
- developmental delay, hypotonia, opisthotonos and ataxia
  - seizures less common
- present as neonate and early childhood

** Genetics
- AR OGDH, DLST, DLD

** Diagnostic Tests
- urine organic acids
  - \uparrow \alpha-KGA \pm other TCA intermediates
  - \alpha-KGA is a common finding, not specific for KDHC deficiency
- blood lactate
  - N-\uparrow L/P
- KDHC activity
  - \ce{^14CO2} release from \ce{[1-^14C]} \alpha-ketoglutarate (or \ce{[1-^14C]} leucine)
  - cultured skin fibroblasts
  - muscle

** Treatment
- none
* Succinate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- four subunits compose Complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain

#+CAPTION[]:Succinate Dehydrogenase | Complex II
#+NAME: tab:sdd
| Subunit | Description                                        |
|---------+----------------------------------------------------|
| SdhA    | succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit       |
| SdhB    | succinate dehydrogenase iron-sulfur subunit        |
| SdhC    | succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b560 subunit    |
| SdhD    | succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b small subunit |

- SdhA contains an FAD binding site where succinate is deprotonated
  and converted to fumarate

\ce{succinate + ubiquinone(Q) ->[CII] fumarate + ubiquinol(QH2)}

- electrons removed from succinate transfer to SdhA
- transfer across SdhB through iron sulphur clusters to the SdhC/SdhD subunits
  - SdhC/SdhD are anchored in the mitochondrial membrane

** Clinical Presentation
- very rare disorder with highly variable phenotype
- Complex II is part of the TCA cycle and ETC
  - phenotype resembles defects in respiratory chain
- clinical picture can include:
  - Kearns-Sayre syndrome
  - isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  - combined cardiac and skeletal myopathy
  - generalized muscle weakness, \uparrow fatigue
  - early onset Leigh encephalopathy
- also:
  - cerebral ataxia
  - optic atropy
  - tumour formation in adults

** Genetics
- AR with highly variable phenotype
- all components of Complex II are encoded by nuclear DNA (Table [[tab:sdgen]])
- mutations in SDHB, SDHC and SDHD cause susceptibility to familial
  phaeochromocytoma and familial paraganglioma

#+CAPTION[]:Succinate Dehydrogenase Genetics
#+NAME: tab:sdgen
| Gene | Location |
|------+----------|
| SDHA | 5p15.33  |
| SDHB | 1p36.13  |
| SDHC | 1q23.3   |
| SDHD | 11q23.1  |

** Diagnostic Tests
- unlike other TCA cycle disorders Complex II deficiency does not always
  result in characteristic organic aciduria
  - succinic aciduria
- organic acids can show variable amounts of lactate, pyruvate, succinate, fumarate and malate
- measurement of complex II activity in muscle is the most reliable
  means of diagnosis
  - no clear correlation between residual complex II activity and
    severity or clinical outcome
** Treatment 
- in some cases treatment with riboflavin may have clinical benefit
  
* Fumarase Deficiency
- fumarase (AKA fumarate hydratase) catalyses reversible
  hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate
\ce{fumarate + H2O <=>[FH] malate}
- two forms: mitochondrial and cytosolic
  - mitochondrial isoenzyme is involved in the TCA Cycle
  - cytosolic isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of amino acids and fumarate
- subcellular localization is established by the presence/absence of an N-terminal mitochondrial signal
  sequence
- deficiency causes impaired energy production

** Clinical Presentation
- characterized by polyhydramnios and fetal brain abnormalities
- newborn period findings include:
  - severe neurologic abnormalities
  - poor feeding
  - failure to thrive
  - hypotonia
- fumarase deficiency is suspected in infants with multiple severe
  neurologic abnormalities in the absence of an acute metabolic crisis
- inactivity of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of fumarase are
  potential causes
** Genetics
- AR, FH encoded by nuclear DNA
- single gene and mRNA encode mito and cyto isoforms
** Diagnostic Tests
- isolated increased concentration of fumaric acid on urine organic
  acid analysis is highly suggestive of fumarase deficiency
  - succinate, \alpha-KGA can also be elevated
- molecular genetic testing for fumarase deficiency
* Isocitrate Dehydrogenase
- IDH exists in three isoforms:
  - IDH3 catalyzes the third step of the citric acid cycle
\ce{isocitrate + NAD+ ->[IHD3] \alpha-ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH + H+}
  - IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the same reaction outside TCA cycle and
    uses \ce{NADP+} as a cofactor
    - localize to the cytosol as well as mitochondria and peroxisomes
\ce{isocitrate + NADP+ ->[IHD1/2] \alpha-ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADPH + H+}

** Clinical Presentation
- IDH3 deficiency is associated with retinitis pigmentosa
- IDH1/2 mutations linked to malignant gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia
