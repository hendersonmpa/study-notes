* Introduction
- ketone bodies (KB) are an important fuel for many tissues including
  cardiac and skeletal muscle during fasting
- particularly important for the brain which cannot oxidise fatty
  acids
- principal KBs acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate are maintained in
  equilibrium by \beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase

 \ce{acetoacetate + NADH <=>[HBDH] \beta-hydroxybutyrate + NAD+}

- acetone is formed from acetoacetate non-enzymatically and eliminated in breath
- formed in liver mitochondria from fatty acids and certain amino acids (e.g. leucine)
- cross cell membranes by diffusion or facilitated by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
  - MCT1 transport is important during catabolic stress, \uparrow flux
- converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues for use as fuel
- one ketolytic enzyme, mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (AKA
  \beta-ketothiolase or T2) is also involved in isoleucine catabolism

- disorders of ketone body metabolism present either in the first few
  days of life or later in childhood, during an infection or some
  other metabolic stress
- the primary aim of treatment is to prevent decompensation
- fasting is avoided and a high glucose intake is maintained at times
  of metabolic stress such as infections

* Ketogenesis Defects
- there are two defects of ketogenesis:
  1. Mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase deficiency
  2. HMG-CoA lyase deficiency


** Clinical Presentation
*** HMG-CoA Synthase Deficiency
- presents with hypoglycaemia
  - often accompanied by coma and metabolic acidosis
  - precipitated by infections with vomiting or poor feeding in early
    childhood (5 months to 6 years of age)
- usually hepatomegaly, which resolves
- hyperammonaemia is rare, (surprisingly) ketonuria may be present
- most patients recover with intravenous glucose

*** HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
- presents with hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, vomiting and a
  reduced level of consciousness
- 30% patients, the onset is within 5 days of birth, after a short symptom-free period
- ~70% patients, symptoms are provoked by an infection in the first year
- few patients present later, occasionally as adults
- KB levels are inappropriately low blood lactate concentrations
  may be markedly elevated, particularly in neonatal onset cases
- often hyperammonaemia, hepatomegaly and abnormal liver function tests and
  may develop pancreatitis or cardiomyopathy
- neurological sequelae included:
  - epilepsy, intellectual handicap, hemiplegia or cerebral visual loss
  - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows diffuse mild signal changes
    in the cerebral white matter on T 2 -weighted images with multiple
    foci of more severe signal abnormality
- myelination may be impaired because KB are a substrate for the
  synthesis of myelin cholesterol

** Metabolic Derangement
- KB are synthesised in hepatic mitochondria, primarily using
  acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation
- HMG-CoA synthase catalyses the condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA and
  acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is cleaved by HMG-CoA lyase to
  release acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate

- \ce{acetyl-CoA + acetoacetyl-CoA + H2O <=>[HMGCS] HMG-CoA + CoA}

- \ce{HMG-CoA <=>[HMGCL] acetoacetate + acetyl-CoA}

- HMG-CoA can also be derived from leucine
- *HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA lyase deficiencies both impair
  ketogenesis*
  - *HMG-CoA lyase deficiency also causes the accumulation of
    intermediates of the leucine catabolic pathway*
- lack of KB synthesis leads to excessive glucose consumption and
  hypoglycaemia during fasting

** Genetics
- HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) and HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL) deficiencies are
  AR

** Diagnostic Tests
- critical sample is important
- if the plasma free fatty acid concentration is raised with an
  inappropriately small rise in total KB it implies a defect of
  ketogenesis or fatty acid oxidation 
  - \Uparrow plasma FFA/total KB >2.5

*** HMG-CoA Synthase Deficiency
- normal metabolic studies when not fasting 
- during decompensation, urine contains saturated, unsaturated and
  3-hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and other
  metabolites
  - \uparrow 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone is the most specific
- plasma acylcarnitines are normal when patients are well
  - raised during illness
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis

*** HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
- urine organic acids
  - \uparrow 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric
  - \uparrow 3-hydroxyisovaleric
  - \uparrow 3-methyl-glutaconic
  - \uparrow 3-methylglutaric 
  - 3-methyl-crotonylglycine may also be present
- plasma acylcarnitines
  - \uparrow C5OH-carnitine (3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine) 
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis or measuring HMG-CoA
  lyase activity in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts

** Treatment
- avoid fasting and maintain  high carbohydrate intake during any
  metabolic stress such as infections
- IV glucose is required if no oral intake or vomiting
*** HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
- IV sodium bicarbonate may be needed if there is severe acidosis
- moderate protein restriction is usually recommended in HMG-CoA
  lyase deficiency because of its role in leucine catabolism

*** HMG-CoA Synthase Deficiency
- HMG-CoA synthase deficiency has a good prognosis


* Ketolysis Defects
- ketone body utilisation is catalysed by:
  1. succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)
  2. mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2)
- SCOT, T2 or MCT1 deficiencies present with episodes of ketoacidosis

** Clinical Presentation
- patients present with episodes of severe ketoacidosis in early childhood
- few patients have seizures or cardiomegaly at the time of presentation
- patients are healthy between episodes, with normal blood pH
- decompensation triggered by fasting or an infection with poor
  feeding and vomiting
- blood glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations are usually normal

** Metabolic Derangement
- KB utilisation occurs in extrahepatic mitochondria, starting with
  the transfer of coenzyme A from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate,
  catalysed by SCOT
- this forms acetoacetyl-CoA, which is converted to acetyl-CoA by T2
- second reaction can also be catalysed to some extent by
  medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (T1)
  - may explain why T2 deficient patients do not have permanent
    ketosis

- \ce{succinyl-CoA + acetoacetate <=>[SCOT] acetoacyl-CoA + succinate}
- \ce{acetoacetyl-CoA + CoA <=>[T2] 2\cdot acetyl-CoA}

- SCOT is not expressed in liver and has no role other than
  ketolysis
- T2 is expressed in liver, involved in ketogenesis and ketolysis
- patients with T2 deficiency present with ketoacidosis
  - T2 more crucial in ketolysis than in ketogenesis
- T2 also cleaves 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA in the isoleucine
  degradation pathway
  - T2 deficiency \to \uparrow isoleucine-derived acyl-CoA esters
  - these may be responsible for neurodevelopmental abnormalities
- ketoacidosis in patients with MCT1 deficiency \to transporters are
  facilitate rapid entry of KB at times of stress
- MCT1 transporters are important for lactate transport
  - expressed in the brain, particularly on oligodendroglia
- learning difficulties in MCT1 deficient patients may be due to the
  absence of MCT1 in the brain

** Genetics
- AR - SCOT (OXCT1), T2 (ACAT1) and MCT1 (SLC16A1)
- heterozygous SLC16A1 and OXCT1 mutations have been found in several
  patients investigated for ketoacidosis, suggesting that they can
  cause problems if subjects are exposed to sufficient stress

- heterozygous SLC16A1 mutations can also cause hyperinsulinemia
  - promoter mutations that prevent the normal silencing of MCT1
    expression in pancreatic \beta-cells

** Diagnostic Tests
*** SCOT & MCT1 Deficiencies
  - \downarrow plasma FFA/total KB <0.3 suggests a defect of ketolysis
- urine organic acids show \uparrow KB but no specific abnormalities
- patients with severe SCOT deficiency have persistent ketonuria in
  the fed state, but patients with a mild mutation do not
- diagnoses are now usually made by mutation analysis
*** T2 Deficiency
- urine OA
  - \uparrow 2-methylacetoacetate
  - \uparrow 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid
  - \uparrow tiglylglycine
  - 2-methylacetoacetate is unstable
- patient with mild mutations may only show abnormalities when they
  are stressed (e.g isoleucine load)
- 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causes a
  similar pattern of organic acids but 2-methyacetoacetate is not excreted
- plasma acylcarnitines
  - \uparrow 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine
  - \uparrow tiglylcarnitine 
  - may be normal with mild mutations
- diagnosis must be confirmed by mutation analysis or enzyme assay in fibroblasts
  - assays are complicated by the presence of other thiolases that act
    on acetoacetyl-CoA


** Treatment
- same as ketogenesis defects above
- T2 involved in isoleucine metabolism \therefore \downarrow protein intake
