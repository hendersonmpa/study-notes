#+TITLE:Oxidative Phosphorylation
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which ATP is formed as a
  result of the transfer of electrons from NADH or FADH_2 to O_2 by a
  series of electron carriers (Figure [[fig:etc]] and [[fig:oxpho]])
- responsible for ATP production
- ETC complexes I-IV
- OxPhos system complexes I-V
- ~ 90 subunits
- 13 subunits of Complexes I, III, IV and V encoded by mtDNA (Table [[tab:subunits]])
- \gt 1500 proteins in the human mitochondrial proteome
- up to 10% of human proteome may have role in maintaining mitochondrial function
- OxPhos requires mitochondrial functions for:
  - protein import, turnover
  - fission, fusion
  - mtDNA replication, transcription and translation
    - \gt 200 proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs
  - cofactors: coenzyme Q_{10}, iron-sulfur clusters, heme, copper
  - cardiolipin for cristae formation

- ETC and OxPhos are coupled by a proton gradient across the IMM
  - efflux of protons from the mitochondrial matrix creates an
    electrochemical gradient
    - used by the F_{0}F_{1} ATP synthase complex to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation
- energy from transfer of electrons down the ETC is used to pump
  protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space
  - creates an electrochemical proton gradient (\Delta{}pH) across the IMM
    - largely responsible for the mitochondrial membrane potential (\Delta\Psi{}M)
  - ATP synthase uses flow of \ce{H+} through the enzyme back into the
    matrix to generate ATP from ADP and Pi
- three energy-transducing enzymes in the electron transport chain:
  - NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I)
  - Coenzyme Q â€“ cytochrome c reductase (complex III)
  - Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV)
  - ETF-QO and mitochondrial glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (GPD) (not part of ETC)

- Complex I (NADH coenzyme Q reductase) accepts electrons from the
  Krebs cycle electron carrier NADH
- passes them to CoQ (ubiquinone)
- CoQ also receives electrons from CII, GDP and ETF-QO

- CoQ passes electrons to complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) which
  passes them to cytochrome c
- cytochrome c passes electrons to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase)
  which uses the electrons and hydrogen ions to reduce molecular
  oxygen to water

  - mechanism: 
    1. seven iron sulfur centers carry electrons from the site of NADH
       oxidation to ubiquinone (Figure [[fig:c1]])
    2. ubiquinone (CoQ) is reduced to ubiquinol (\ce{CoQH2})
    3. the energy from the redox reaction results in conformational
       change allowing hydrogen ions to pass through four transmembrane
       helix channels

#+END_EXPORT

- formation of ATP from ADP and P_{i} is energetically unfavourable
  - would normally proceed in the reverse direction

- to drive this reaction forward, ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis
  to the electrochemical gradient (\Delta\Psi{}M) created by complexes
  I, III and IV
- ATP synthase consists of two main subunits, F_0 and F_1,
  - a rotational motor mechanism \to ATP production

 - clinical diagnosis is extremely challenging
   - can affect any organ system
   - antenatal (IUGR, birth defects) \to elderly (myopathy)

 - clinical suspicion based on:
   1) constellation of symptoms/signs consistent with a mitochondrial syndrome (Table [[tab:oxpclin]])
   2) complex multi-system presentation involving two/more organ systems,
      best described by an underlying disorder of energy generation
   3) lactic acidosis, characteristic neuro-imaging, 3-methylglutaconic
      aciduria, ragged red fiber mypopathy
   4) pathogenic mutation in a known mitochondrial disease gene
