#+TITLE: Oligosaccharidoses
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- almost all the secreted and membrane associated proteins of the body
  are glycosylated
  - also numerous intracellular proteins such as lysosomal acid hydrolases
- a variety of oligosaccharide chains are attached to the protein
  backbone via:
  - hydroxyl group of serine or threonine (O-linked)
  - amide group of asparagine (N-linked)
- chains usually have a core composed of N-acetylglucosamine and mannose
  - often contain galactose, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine
  - frequently terminal sialic acids (N-acetylneuraminic acid)
- oligosaccharide chains with a terminal mannose-6-phosphate are
  involved in the targeting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes
  - defects in synthesis of the M6P recognition marker \to
    mislocalisation of lysosomal enzymes
- deficiencies of the enzymes required for the degradation of the
  oligosaccharide chains cause oligosaccharidoses

* Oligosaccharidoses
** Clinical Presentation
 - oligosaccharidoses share many features in common with MPS disorders (Table [[tab:oligo]])
   - urine GAG screen is normal or only shows nonspecific
     abnormalities

*** Mannosidosis
 - deficiency of \alpha-mannosidase \to variable disorder \alpha-mannosidosis
 - mild Hurler phenotype
   - variable learning difficulties
   - hepatosplenomegaly
   - deafness
   - skeletal dysplasia
 - complicated by an immune deficiency which can dominate the clinical
   progression of the disease

 - \beta-mannosidosis due to deficiency of \beta-mannosidase
   - much less prevalent than \alpha-mannosidosis
   - very variable, but severe learning difficulties, challenging
     behaviour, deafness and frequent infections are relatively common

*** Fucosidosis
 - lack the typical facial dysmorphism
 - deficiency of \alpha-fucosidase \to variable neurodegenerative disorder
 - often with seizures and mild dysostosis
 - often exhibit prominent and widespread angiokeratomas, progress with age

*** Galactosialidosis
 - combined deficiency of the lysosomal enzymes \beta-galactosidase and
   \alpha-neuraminidase
 - results from a defect in protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA)
   - an intralysosomal protein which protects these enzymes from
     premature proteolytic processing
 - presentation varies from:
   - hydrops fetalis
   - slowly progressive disorder associated with learning
     difficulties, dysostosis multiplex and corneal opacity

** Genetics
 - AR
** Diagnostic Tests
- clinical suspicion
- urine oligosaccharide excretion
  - 1D TLC
  - treated with orcinol reagent and heated to 100\degreeC to visualize
- usually normal urine GAGs
- enzyme activity assays (Table [[tab:oligo]])

** Treatment
- supportive
