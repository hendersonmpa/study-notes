#+TITLE: Oligosaccharidoses

* Introduction

- almost all the secreted and membrane associated proteins of the body
  are glycosylated, as well as numerous intracellular
  proteins,including the lysosomal acid hydrolases
- a great variety of oligosaccharide chains are attached to the
  protein backbone via:
  - the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine (O-linked)
  - via the amide group of asparagine (N-linked)

- chains usually have a core composed of N-acetylglucosamine and mannose
- often contain galactose, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine
- frequently terminal sialic acids (N-acetylneuraminic acid)
- oligosaccharide chains with a terminal mannose-6-phosphate are
  involved in the targeting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes
- this recognition marker is synthesised in two steps from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine

- deficiencies of the enzymes required for the degradation of the
  oligosaccharide chains cause oligosaccharidoses (glycoprotein storage diseases)

- defects of the synthesis of the mannose-6-phosphate recognition
  marker result in the mislocalisation of lysosomal enzymes

* Disorders
** Mannosidosis
- deficiency of \alpha-mannosidase \to variable disorder \alpha-mannosidosis. 
- mild Hurler phenotype
  - variable learning difficulties
  - hepatosplenomegaly
  - deafness
  - skeletal dysplasia,
- complicated by an immune deficiency which can dominate the clinical progression of the disease

- \beta-mannosidosis, deficiency of \beta-mannosidase,
  - is much less prevalent than \alpha-mannosidosis
  - and is very variable, but severe learning difficulties,
    challenging behaviour, deafness and frequent infections are
    relatively common

** Fucosidosis
- lack the typical facial dysmorphism
- deficiency of \alpha-fucosidase \to variable neurodegenerative disorder
- often with seizures and mild dysostosis
- often exhibit prominent and widespread angiokeratomas, progress with age

** Galactosialidosis
- combined deficiency of the lysosomal enzymes \beta-galactosidase and \alpha-neuraminidase
- results from a defect in protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA)
- an intralysosomal protein which protects these enzymes from premature proteolytic processing
- presentation includes:
  - hydrops fetalis as well as a more slowly progressive disorder
    associated with learning difficulties, dysostosis multiplex and corneal opacity
