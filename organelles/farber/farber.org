#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB

* Introduction
- very rare Farber lipogranulomatosis is clinically heterogeneous
  - often presents during infancy causing death within the 1st year
  - later onset cases (up to an adult age) have been described
  - as well as foetal forms
- deficiency of acid ceramidase activity leads to the storage of
  ceramides in various organs
* Genetics
- \gt 30 mutations of ASAH1 including a large deletion
* Clinical 
- most frequent signs are painful joint swelling, deformation and contractures, periarticular subcutaneous nodules and hoarseness due to laryngeal involvement
- some patients mimics juvenile idiopathic arthritis
- hepatomegaly and a macular cherry-red spot may be present
- neurological manifestations are of variable severity
  - mild to psychomotor deterioration and epilepsy
  - juvenile-onset patients may show neurological involvement only

* Diagnosis
- ASAH1 genetics
- EM of nodule or of a skin biopsy
  - inclusions with typical curvilinear bodies in histiocytes
  - banana bodies in Schwann cells

* Treatment
- none
