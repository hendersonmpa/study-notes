#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB

* Introduction
- Farber lipogranulomatosis is very rare and clinically heterogeneous
  - often presents during infancy causing death within the 1st year
  - later onset cases (up to an adult age) have been described
  - as well as foetal forms
- deficiency of *acid ceramidase* activity
  - leads to the storage of ceramides in various organs
* Genetics
- AR ASAH1
* Clinical 
- most frequent signs are painful joint swelling, deformation and
  contractures, periarticular subcutaneous nodules and hoarseness due
  to laryngeal involvement
- neurodegeneration
- some patients mimics juvenile idiopathic arthritis
- hepatomegaly and cherry-red spot may be present

* Diagnosis
- ASAH1 genetics
- EM of nodule or of a skin biopsy
  - inclusions with typical curvilinear bodies in histiocytes
  - banana bodies in Schwann cells

* Treatment
- none
- HSCT trial with poor outcome
