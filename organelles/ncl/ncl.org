* Introduction
- NCLs are a group of inherited progressive neurodegenerative diseases
  - among the most frequent in childhood
- NCL is widely used in Europe, "Batten disease" is common in the USA
- wide clinical diversity is a result of  wide genetic heterogeneity
  - 13 different genes identified
  - five of them encode soluble proteins
  - others encode transmembrane proteins whose function and possible
    interactions still remain incompletely understood
- NCLs are now considered as lysosomal storage diseases, due to the
  lysosomal accumulation of lipopigments and localisation of several
  NCL proteins to the lysosome

* Clinical Presentation
- characterised by progressive psychomotor retardation, seizures,
  visual loss and early death
- four main clinical forms based on age of onset and order of
  appearance of clinical signs
  1. infantile - common in southern europe
  2. late infantile - common in southern europe
  3. juvenile - anglo-saxon
  4. adult - rare
- now included classification based on genetic loci

* Metabolic Derangement
- accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipopigments mainly in
  neural tissues
  - saposins A and D in infantile forms
  - subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase in late infantile and
    juvenile forms
  - not disease causing they are secondary markers
- many CLN proteins
  - many in lysosome but also mitochondria, ER and vesicular membranes
- role in autophagy and apoptosis
  - CLN1 :: S-fatty acylated protein degradation
  - CLN2 :: lysosomal serine protease
  - cathepsin D :: endopepidatase
  - cathepsin F :: peptidase

* Genetics
- AR
- adult form is AD
* Diagnostic Tests
- electrophysiological studies
- EM tissue biopsy with vacuolated lymphocytes
- WBC or fibroblast enzyme studies
  - CLN1 or 2
  - cathepsin D or F

* Treatment 
- symptomatic treatment
- control seizures
