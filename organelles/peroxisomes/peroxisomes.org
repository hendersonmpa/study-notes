* Introduction
** Peroxisomal FA oxidation
- \beta-oxidation of:
  - very-long-chain fatty acids
    - C22:6-CoA, C22:5-CoA, C26:1-CoA, C26:0-CoA
    - do not degrade fatty acids to completion
  - bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid
  - a range of eicosanoids
- \alpha-oxidation of phytanoyl-CoA \to pristanoly-CoA
  - \beta-oxidation of pristanoly-CoA

- Two acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX1 & 2)
- Two bifunctional proteins (LBP & DBP)
- Two thiolases (ACAA1 & SCPx). 
- Single enzyme or transport protein defect result in abnormalities in some fatty acids.

** Peroxisomal Disorders
- Peroxisomal \beta-oxidation disorders can be subdivided into two groups:
  1) single peroxisomal enzyme or transport protein deficiencies
     - X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD)
     - D-Bifunctional Protein (DBP) Deficiency
     - Acyl-CoA Oxidase (ACOX) Deficiency
     - Methyl Acyl-CoA Racemase (AMACR) Deficiency
  2) generalized peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiencies.
     - Zellweger syndrome 
- Peroxisomal \alpha-oxidation disorders
  - Adult Refsum
- Sjogren Larsson Syndrome

- Rare Peroxisomal Disorders 
  - Etherphospholipid Biosynthesis
    - Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata (RCDP) 1-4
  - FA Elongation disorders
    - EVOL4, EVOL5,
    - Trans-2,3-Enoyl-CoA Reductase (TER), 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydratase 1 (HACD1)
  - Eicosanoid Metabolism
    - Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy Type 1
    - LTC4-Synthase Deficiency

* X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy
** Clinical Presentation
- 1/20,000 males and females
*** ALD
- childhood cerebral form is the most severe
  - neurological symptoms between 4-12 years
  - vegetative state and death
- Males may present with ADD or behavioural changes
  - due to visuospatial deficits \pm central hearing loss
- followed by severe visual and hearing impairment, quadriplegia and
  cerebellar ataxia.
*** AMN
- Adrenomyeloneuropathy affects 65% of adult X-ALD male patients (20-50 years)
  - up to 88% of heterozygous women (\gt40 years)
- Presentation is progressive spastic paraparesis and sensory ataxia.

** Metabolic Derangement
- Deficiency in ALDP a peroxisomal ABC transporter
- \to \uparrow VLCFA-CoA in cytosol
  - incorporation into a variety of lipids including:
  - cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and sphingolipids
- VLCFAs accumulate in virtually all tissues, including erythrocytes,
  white blood cells and plasma.

** Genetics
- X-ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1
- X-linked

** Diagnostic Tests

- Quantitative VLCFAs including:C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0 in plasma
  - after alkaline and acid hydrolysis
  - releases the VLCFAs from all lipid species
  - \uparrow concentration of C26:0
  - \uparrow C26:0/C22:0 and C24:0/C22:0 ratios

- In females, normal plasma VLCFA does not exclude XALD
  - mutation analysis is the most reliable method for diagnosis in females

- False-positive results have been reported in:
  - patients on a ketogenic diet
  - recent ingestion of peanut butter

** Treatment
- A boy born with X-ALD has a 35% risk of developing cerebral ALD
  between the age of 4-12 years
- 100% risk of developing AMN between the age of 25-50 years.
- Cerebral X-ALD can be treated in boys and adult males
  - only at a very early stage of the disease,
  - when patients start to develop cerebral demyelination on brain MRI
    but have no or minimal neurologic symptoms.
- HCT can arrest the cerebral demyelination when the procedure is
  performed at a very early stage

* Zellweger Spectrum Disorders
- This group of conditions includes:
  - Zellweger syndrome
  - Neonatal Adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD)
  - Infantile Refsum disease.

- Once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered to be
  part of the same condition spectrum.

- Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form of the Zellweger spectrum disorder
- NALD is intermediate in severity
- infantile Refsum disease is the least severe form.
- Because these three conditions are now considered one disorder, some
  researchers prefer not to use the separate condition names but to
  instead refer to cases as severe, intermediate, or mild.

** Clinical Presentation
*** Zellweger Syndrome
- presents in newborn period
  - develop life-threatening problems in other organs and tissues, such as:
    - the liver, heart, and kidneys.
  - may have skeletal abnormalities including:
    - a large space between the bones of the skull (fontanelles)
    - characteristic bone spots known as chondrodysplasia punctata seen on x-ray.
- Prototypical ZS:
  1) Typical cranial facial dysmorphia including:
     - high forehead
     - large interior fontanelle
     - hypoplastic supraorbital ridges
     - epicanthal folds
     - flat nasal bridge
     - deformed ear lobes
  2) Profound neurological abnormalities
- Children with ZS typically do not survive beyond the first year of life.

*** NALD and IRD
 - less-severe end of the spectrum
 - have more variable features than those with Zellweger syndrome
 - usually do not develop signs and symptoms of the disease until late infancy or early childhood.
 - many of the features of ZS but progresses more slowly.
   - hypotonia, vision problems, hearing loss, liver dysfunction,
     developmental delay, and some degree of intellectual
     disability.
 - NALD survive into childhood,
 - IRD may reach adulthood.

** Metabolic Derangement
- Absence or marked deficiency of peroxisomes
  - assessed by catalase-staining in fibroblasts
  - using immunofluorescence microscopy analysis
- All peroxisomal functions are impaired.
- In classical ZSD abnormalities include:
  - \uparrow VLCFAs
  - \uparrow pristanic acid,
  - \uparrow di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid,
  - \uparrow pipecolic acid
  - \downarrow plasmalogens in erythrocytes

** Genetics
- The genetic basis of the ZSD is heterogeneous
- Biallelic mutations identified in:
  - PEX1, PEX2, PEX3, PEX5, PEX6, PEX10, PEX12, PEX13, PEX14, PEX16, PEX19, and PEX26
- All disorders are autosomal recessive

** Diagnostic Tests
- VLCFA analysis is a good initial biochemical test
- erythrocyte plasmalogens
- pipecolic acid in urine or plasma
  - elevations in pipecolic acid also occur in:
    - pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy
    - sulfite oxidase deficiency
- DNA-panel containing all PEX genes or all genes coding for
  peroxisomal protein

** Treatment
- No treatment available
- supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is not beneficial
- Investigating cholic acid supplementation to reduce formation of the
  toxic bile acid intermediates DHCA and THCA

* Adult Refsum Disease
** Clinical Presentation
- present in late childhood with:
  - progressive loss of night vision
  - decline in visual capacity
  - anosmia
- After \ge 10 years patients may develop:
  - deafness, ataxia, polyneuropathy, ichthyosis, fatigue, and cardiac
    conduction disturbances
- full constellation of features defined by Refsum includes:
  - retinitis pigmentosa, cerebellar ataxia and chronic polyneuropathy
- rarely seen in single patients with ARD

** Metabolic derangement
- Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is deficient in ARD
- required for \alpha-oxidation of phytanic acid
- \to accumulation of phytanic acid 

#+CAPTION[oxidation of phytanic]:Oxidation of Phytanic Acid

[[file:./peroxisomes/figures/alpha.png]]

** Genetics
- ARD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in PHYH.
- A large number of often private mutations has been identified

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow plasma phytanic acid 
- \uparrow phytanic acid in ZS
  - initially called infantile Refsum

** Treatment
- Dietary restriction of phytanic acid 
  - critical to minimize ongoing tissue accumulation.
- The largest sources of phytanic acid and its metabolic precursor phytol are:
  - dairy products, meats and certain fish
- vegetables do not need to be restricted
  - phytanic acid is not released from chlorophyll
- avoid rapid weight loss
  - may mobilize phytanic acid from adipose tissue
- Can halt progression of symptoms and some functional recovery if the
  disease is recognized early and dietary restriction and regular
  lipid apheresis are maintained life-long.

* Sj\ouml{}gren Larsson Syndrome
** Clinical Presentation
- Classical tetrad of abnormalities in SLS includes:
  1) ichthyosis
  2) spasticity
  3) ophthalmological abnormalities
  4) intellectual disability
- full-blown phenotype of SLS is not observed in all patients
- manifests later on in childhood \gt 3 years of age.

** Metabolic Derangement
- Enzyme deficient in SLS is fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH)
- degradation of long-chain fatty alcohols and leukotriene B4

** Genetics
- SLS is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in
  ALD-H3A2
- a range of different mutations including missense, nonsense,
  splice-site and deletions has been reported.
 
** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow long-chain fatty alcohols in plasma
- \uparrow LTB4 metabolites in urine.
  - No easy methods have been described to measure these metabolites
- enzymatic analysis is the method of choice
  - can be done in polymorphonuclear lymphocytes using pyrenedecanal as substrate
  - identification of FALDH-deficiency in candidate patients.

** Treatment
- Treatment of SLS patients is focused on the spasticity and prevention of contracture development.
- One of the key problems in SLS patients is the striking pruritus
  - may originate from LTB4 accumulation.
- Zileuton, inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking its biosynthesis
  - effective in managing chronic (severe) asthma.
- improvement of pruritus
  - \downarrow urinary LTB4
  - \downarrow lipid peak on MRS.
- A double-blind placebo controlled trial is currently underway

* Disorders of Etherphospholipid (RCDP)
- Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata (RCDP) is the classical
  phenotype of a etherphospholipid biogenesis defect

- Patients with classical RCDP have:
  - skeletal dysplasia characterized by rhizomelia, chondrodysplasia punctata (stippled calcification in epiphyseal cartilage), bone abnormalities, profound growth retardation and limited joint mobility,
  - congenital cataracts
  - facial abnormalities including a high forehead, flat midface and small upturned nose.
- Until very recently only three different disorders ofEPL-biosynthesis were known, including:
  1) PEX7 deficiency
  2) glycerone 3-phosphate: acyltransferase (GNPAT) deficiency
  3) alkylglycerone 3-phosphate synthase (AGPS) deficiency

- in the last two years two additional disorders of EPL biosynthesis have been identified including FAR1 deficiency and PEX5L deficiency.

** Pex7 Deficiency (RCDP 1)

- RCDP type 1 as caused by mutations in PEX7
- most frequent among the cohort of RCDP patients (> 150 patients).
- PEX7 codes for one of two peroxisomal cycling receptors and targets PTS2-signal to the peroxisome
- Three PTS2-containing peroxisomal enzymes are known 
  1) peroxisomal 3-keto acyl-CoA thiolase
  2) alkylglycerone phosphate synthase
  3) phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase
- Not imported into peroxisomes in PEX7 deficiency
  - defects in plasmalogen biosynthesis and \alpha-oxidation
- The deficiency of 3-keto acyl-CoA thiolase 1 has no functional
  consequences for VLCFA degradation because the second peroxisomal
  thiolase (SCPx) can also handle 3-keto-VLCFAs.

- The clinical phenotype associated with mutations in PEX7 is heterogeneous
  - ranging from the classical phenotype as described above to much milder phenotypes including RCDP without rhizomelia
  - bone dysplasia with only mild intellectual deficiency to a Refsum-like phenotype

** Glycerone 3-Phosphate Acyltransferase (GNPAT) Deficiency (RCDP type 2)
- mutations in GNPAT
- one of the two intraperoxisomal enzymes involved in EPL biosynthesis
- 10 patients with this subtype have been reported in literature
- all presented with the characteristic severe clinical phenotype of
  RCDP with most patients dying in the first decade of life

** Alkylglycerone 3-Phosphate Synthase (AGPS) Deficiency (RCDP Type 3)
- mutations in AGPS
- the second intraperoxisomal enzyme involved in EPL-biosynthesis
- catalyses the formation of the characteristic ether bond in etherphospholipids
- RCDP type 3 is even less frequent when compared to type 2
- five patients have been reported in literature
- all of whom showed the severe lethal RCDP phenotype
* Fatty Acid Chain Elongation Disorders
- FA from dietary sources or synthesized/de novo/ via the FAS complex,
  can be converted into longer-chain fatty acids either saturated,
  mono- or polyunsaturated.
- chain elongation system localized in the ER,
- desaturases add double-bonds at specific positions
- Chain elongation allows the stepwise extension of fatty acids by two
  carbon atoms and involves a four-step pathway mediated by
  - ELOVL 1-7 (condensation)
  - KAR (first reduction)
  - HACD 1-4 (hydratation)
  - TER (second and final reduction)
  - to produce the corresponding (n+2) acyl-CoA.
- The introduction of double-bonds by desaturases.
- Mammals only express delta9, delta6 and delta5 desaturase activities
  and the enzymes involved belong to two distinct families:
  - Stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs)
    - delta9 desaturation
  - Fatty acid desaturases (FADS)
    - Delta6 and delta5 desaturation

** Disorders
- EVOL4 Deficiency
- EVOL5 Deficiency
- Trans-2,3-Enoyl-CoA Reductase (TER) Deficiency
- 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydratase 1(HACD1) Deficiency

* Disorders of Eicosanoid Metabolism
- eicosanoids constitute a large variety of biologically active
 molecules derived from arachidonic acid after liberation from
 cellular membranes by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) through three main pathways:
  1) the cyclooxygenase (COX)
  2) lipoxygenase (LOX)
  3) cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase

- COX pathway generates the different prostaglandins:
  - PGE2, PGD2, PGF2Alpha, PGI2, and TXA2

- LOX-pathway generates:
  - HETEs (5-,8-,12-, and 15-HETE) plus the leukotrienes LTA4
    (unstable), LTB4,LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4

- P_{450} pathway produces HETEs, HPETEs and EETs

** Disorders 
- Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy
  - Type 1 (PHOAR1): 15-Hydroxy Prostaglandin Dehydrogenase (PGDH) Deficiency
  - Type 2 (PHOAR2): Prostaglandin Transporter (PGT) Deficiency

- Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy (PHO) is a disorder characterized by
  changes to the skin and bones, and occurs either in a rare
  familial, primary form (PHO: primary hypertrophic
  osteoarthropathy), also called pachydermoperiostosis (PDP) or, more
  commonly, secondary to other pathologies.

- Key features include digital clubbing, periostosis with bone and
  joint enlargement, and skin changes, such as pachydermia, abnormal
  furrowing, seborrhea, and hyperhidrosis.
