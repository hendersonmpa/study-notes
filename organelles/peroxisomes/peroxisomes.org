#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- peroxisomes are required for \beta-oxidation of:
  - very-long-chain fatty acids
    - C22:6-CoA, C22:5-CoA, C26:1-CoA, C26:0-CoA
    - do not degrade fatty acids to completion
  - bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid
  - a range of eicosanoids
- \alpha-oxidation of phytanoyl-CoA \to pristanoly-CoA
  - \beta-oxidation of pristanoly-CoA

- two acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX1 & 2)
- two bifunctional proteins (LBP & DBP)
- two thiolases (ACAA1 & SCPx). 
- single enzyme or transport protein defect result in abnormalities in some fatty acids

* X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy
** Clinical Presentation
- three forms:
  1. childhood cerebral form
     - more severe
     - neurological symptoms between 4-12 years
     - vegetative state and death
     - males may present with ADD or behavioural changes
     - followed by severe visual and hearing impairment, quadriplegia and
       cerebellar ataxia
  2. adrenomyeloneuropathy
     - 65% of adult X-ALD male patients (20-50 years)
     - up to 88% of heterozygous women (\gt40 years)
     - presentation is progressive spastic paraparesis and sensory ataxia
  3. Addison disease only
     - primary adrenocortical insufficiency commonly by age 7.5 years
     - without evidence of neurologic abnormality
       - some neurologic disability (most commonly AMN) usually
         develops by middle age

** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency in ALDP a peroxisomal ABC transporter
  - required for import of VLCFAs (\pm CoA) into peroxisomes
    - \uparrow VLCFA-CoA in cytosol
    - incorporation into a variety of lipids including:
      - cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and sphingolipids
- VLCFAs accumulate in virtually all tissues, including erythrocytes,
  white blood cells and plasma

** Genetics
- X-linked ABCD1

** Diagnostic Tests
- quantitative VLCFAs including: C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0 in plasma
  - alkaline and acid hydrolysis releases the VLCFAs from all lipid
    species
  - \uparrow concentration of C26:0
  - \uparrow C26:0/C22:0
  - \uparrow C24:0/C22:0

- in females, normal plasma VLCFA does not exclude XALD
  - mutation analysis is the most reliable method for diagnosis in females

- false-positive results have been reported in:
  - patients on a ketogenic diet
  - recent ingestion of peanut butter

** Treatment
- a boy born with X-ALD has a 35% risk of developing cerebral ALD
  between the age of 4-12 years
- 100% risk of developing AMN between the age of 25-50 years
- cerebral X-ALD can be treated in boys and adult males
  - only at a very early stage of the disease
  - when patients start to develop cerebral demyelination on brain MRI
    but have no or minimal neurologic symptoms
- HSCT can arrest the cerebral demyelination when the procedure is
  performed at a very early stage

* Zellweger Spectrum Disorders
- this group of conditions includes:
  - Zellweger Syndrome
  - Neonatal Adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD)
  - Infantile Refsum Disease
- once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered to be
  part of the same condition spectrum
- Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form of the Zellweger spectrum disorder
- NALD is intermediate in severity
- IRD is the least severe form

** Clinical Presentation
*** Zellweger Syndrome
- presents in newborn period
  - develop life-threatening problems in other organs and tissues
    - liver, heart, and kidneys
  - may have skeletal abnormalities
    - large space between the bones of the skull (fontanelles)
    - characteristic bone spots known as chondrodysplasia punctata seen on x-ray
- prototypical ZS:
  1) typical cranial facial dysmorphia
     - high forehead
     - large interior fontanelle
     - hypoplastic supraorbital ridges
     - epicanthal folds
     - flat nasal bridge
     - deformed ear lobes
  2) profound neurological abnormalities
- children with ZS typically do not survive beyond the first year of life

*** NALD and IRD
 - less-severe
 - have more variable features than those with Zellweger syndrome
 - usually do not develop signs and symptoms of the disease until late
   infancy or early childhood
 - many of the features of ZS but progresses more slowly
   - hypotonia, vision problems, hearing loss, liver dysfunction,
     developmental delay, and some degree of intellectual
     disability
 - NALD survive into childhood
 - IRD may reach adulthood

** Metabolic Derangement
- absence or marked deficiency of peroxisomes
  - assessed by catalase-staining in fibroblasts
  - using immunofluorescence microscopy analysis
- all peroxisomal functions are impaired
- classical ZSD abnormalities include:
  - \uparrow VLCFAs
  - \uparrow pristanic acid
  - \uparrow di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid
  - \uparrow pipecolic acid
  - \downarrow plasmalogens in erythrocytes

** Genetics
- genetic basis of the ZSD is heterogeneous
- biallelic mutations identified in:
  - PEX1, PEX2, PEX3, PEX5, PEX6, PEX10, PEX12, PEX13, PEX14, PEX16, PEX19, and PEX26
- all disorders are autosomal recessive

** Diagnostic Tests
- VLCFA analysis is a good initial biochemical test
- erythrocyte plasmalogens
- pipecolic acid in urine or plasma
  - elevations in pipecolic acid also occur in:
    - pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy
    - sulfite oxidase deficiency
- DNA-panel containing all PEX genes or all genes coding for
  peroxisomal protein

** Treatment
- no treatment available
- supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is not beneficial
- investigating cholic acid supplementation to reduce formation of the
  toxic bile acid intermediates DHCA and THCA

* Refsum Disease
** Clinical Presentation
- present in late childhood with:
  - progressive loss of night vision
  - decline in visual capacity
  - loose sense of smell (anosmia)
- after \ge 10 years patients may develop:
  - deafness, ataxia, polyneuropathy, ichthyosis, fatigue, and cardiac
    conduction disturbances
- full constellation of features defined by Refsum includes:
  - retinitis pigmentosa, cerebellar ataxia and chronic polyneuropathy
- rarely seen in single patients with Refsum

** Metabolic derangement
- phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is deficient in Refsum
- required for \alpha-oxidation of phytanic acid
  - accumulation of phytanic acid

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.3\textwidth
[[file:./peroxisomes/figures/alpha.png]]

** Genetics
- AR PHYH

** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow plasma phytanic acid 
- \uparrow phytanic acid in ZS
  - initially called infantile Refsum

** Treatment
- dietary restriction of phytanic acid 
  - critical to minimize ongoing tissue accumulation
- largest sources of phytanic acid and its metabolic precursor phytol are:
  - dairy products, meats and certain fish
- vegetables do not need to be restricted
  - phytanic acid is not released from chlorophyll
- avoid rapid weight loss
  - may mobilize phytanic acid from adipose tissue
- can halt progression of symptoms and some functional recovery if the
  disease is recognized early and dietary restriction and regular
  lipid apheresis are maintained life-long

* Sj\ouml{}gren Larsson Syndrome
** Clinical Presentation
- classical tetrad of abnormalities in SLS includes:
  1) ichthyosis
  2) spasticity
  3) ophthalmological abnormalities
  4) intellectual disability
- full-blown phenotype of SLS is not observed in all patients
- manifests later on in childhood \gt 3 years of age

** Metabolic Derangement
- enzyme deficient in SLS is fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH)
- degradation of long-chain fatty alcohols and leukotriene B4

** Genetics
- AR ALDH3A2
 
** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow long-chain fatty alcohols in plasma
- \uparrow leukotriene in urine
  - difficult methods
- enzymatic analysis is the method of choice
  - can be done in polymorphonuclear lymphocytes
  - pyrenedecanal as substrate

** Treatment
- treatment of SLS patients is focused on the spasticity and
  prevention of contracture development
- one of the key problems in SLS patients is the striking pruritus (itch)
  - may originate from LTB4 accumulation
- zileuton, inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking its biosynthesis
  - effective in managing chronic (severe) asthma
- improvement of pruritus
  - \downarrow urinary LTB4
  - \downarrow lipid peak on MRS

* Disorders of Etherphospholipid (RCDP)
** Clinical Presentation
- Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata (RCDP) is the classical
  phenotype of a etherphospholipid biogenesis defect
- patients with classical RCDP have:
  - skeletal dysplasia characterized by rhizomelia, chondrodysplasia punctata (stippled calcification in epiphyseal cartilage), bone abnormalities, profound growth retardation and limited joint mobility,
  - congenital cataracts
  - facial abnormalities including a high forehead, flat midface and small upturned nose
- three different disorders of EPL-biosynthesis:
  1) PEX7 deficiency
     - clinical phenotype associated with mutations in PEX7 is heterogeneous
       - ranging from the classical phenotype as described above to much
	 milder phenotypes including RCDP without rhizomelia
       - bone dysplasia with only mild intellectual deficiency to a Refsum-like phenotype
  2) glycerone 3-phosphate: acyltransferase (GNPAT) deficiency
     - rare (10 cases)
     - all presented with the characteristic severe clinical phenotype
       of RCDP with most patients dying in the first decade of life
  3) alkylglycerone 3-phosphate synthase (AGPS) deficiency
     - rare (5 cases)
     - all of whom showed the severe lethal RCDP phenotype
- recently two additional disorders of EPL biosynthesis have been
  identified:
  - FAR1 deficiency and PEX5L deficiency

** Metabolic Derangement
*** RCDP Type 1
 - RCDP type 1 is caused by mutations in PEX7
   - most frequent among the cohort of RCDP patients
 - PEX7 codes for one of two peroxisomal cycling receptors and targets
   PTS2-signal to the peroxisome
 - three PTS2-containing peroxisomal enzymes are known 
   1) peroxisomal 3-keto acyl-CoA thiolase
   2) alkylglycerone phosphate synthase
   3) phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase
 - not imported into peroxisomes in PEX7 deficiency
   - defects in plasmalogen biosynthesis and \alpha-oxidation
 - deficiency of 3-keto acyl-CoA thiolase 1 has no functional
   consequences for VLCFA degradation
   - another peroxisomal thiolase (SCPx) can also handle 3-keto-VLCFAs

*** RCDP Type 2
 - Glycerone 3-Phosphate Acyltransferase Deficiency 
 - mutations in GNPAT
 - one of the two intraperoxisomal enzymes involved in EPL biosynthesis

*** RCDP Type 3
 - Alkylglycerone 3-Phosphate Synthase Deficiency 
 - mutations in AGPS
 - the second intraperoxisomal enzyme involved in EPL-biosynthesis
 - catalyses the formation of the characteristic ether bond in etherphospholipids

** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow RBC plasmalogens
*** RDCP1
- \uparrow phytanic
- \downarrow pristanic
  - normal in single enzyme deficiencies

** Treatment
- phytanic acid restriction

* Fatty Acid Chain Elongation Disorders
- FA from dietary sources or synthesized /de novo/ via the FAS complex,
  can be converted into longer-chain fatty acids either saturated,
  mono- or polyunsaturated
- chain elongation system localized in the ER
- desaturases add double-bonds at specific positions
- chain elongation allows the stepwise extension of fatty acids by two
  carbon atoms and involves a four-step pathway mediated by:
  - ELOVL 1-7 (condensation)
  - KAR (first reduction)
  - HACD 1-4 (hydratation)
  - TER (second and final reduction)
  - to produce the corresponding (n+2) acyl-CoA
- introduction of double-bonds by desaturases
- mammals only express delta9, delta6 and delta5 desaturase activities
  - enzymes involved belong to two distinct families:
    - stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs)
      - delta9 desaturation
    - fatty acid desaturases (FADS)
      - delta6 and delta5 desaturation

** Disorders
- EVOL4 Deficiency
- EVOL5 Deficiency
- Trans-2,3-Enoyl-CoA Reductase (TER) Deficiency
- 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydratase 1(HACD1) Deficiency

* Disorders of Eicosanoid Metabolism
- eicosanoids constitute a large variety of biologically active
  molecules derived from arachidonic acid after liberation from
  cellular membranes by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) through three main
  pathways:
  1) cyclooxygenase (COX)
  2) lipoxygenase (LOX)
  3) cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase

- COX pathway generates the different prostaglandins:
  - PGE2, PGD2, PGF2Alpha, PGI2, and TXA2

- LOX-pathway generates:
  - HETEs (5-,8-,12-, and 15-HETE) plus the leukotrienes LTA4
    (unstable), LTB4,LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4

- P_{450} pathway produces HETEs, HPETEs and EETs

** Disorders 
- Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy
  - Type 1 (PHOAR1): 15-Hydroxy Prostaglandin Dehydrogenase (PGDH) Deficiency
  - Type 2 (PHOAR2): Prostaglandin Transporter (PGT) Deficiency

- Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy (PHO) is a disorder characterized by
  changes to the skin and bones

- occurs either in a rare familial, primary form (PHO: primary
  hypertrophic osteoarthropathy), also called pachydermoperiostosis
  (PDP) or, more commonly, secondary to other pathologies

- key features include digital clubbing, periostosis with bone and
  joint enlargement, and skin changes, such as pachydermia, abnormal
  furrowing, seborrhea, and hyperhidrosis
