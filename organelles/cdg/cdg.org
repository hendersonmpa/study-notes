#+TITLE: Congenital Disorders of N-Linked Glycosylation
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- Most extracellular proteins, membrane proteins and several
  intracellular proteins (lysosomal enzymes), are glycoproteins.

- glycans are defined by their linkage to the protein:
  - N-glycans are linked to the amide group of asparagine
  - O-glycans are linked to the hydroxyl group of serine or
    threonine.

- Congenital disorders of glycosylation are due to defects in the
  synthesis of glycans and in the attachment of glycans to proteins
  and lipids.
- Rapidly growing disease family (N-,O-,GPI)
  - ~60 listed on NORD
  - 1% of HG involved in glycosylation

** Synthesis of N-glycans
1) Formation in the cytosol of nucleotide-linked sugars
   - mainly GDP-Man, UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc
   - attachment of GlcNAc and Man units to dolichol phosphate
   - flipping into the ER
2) Stepwise assembly in the ER
   - addition of Man and Glc \to 14-unit oligosaccharide precuror:
   - dolichol pyrophosphate-GlcNac_2-Man_9-Glu_3
3) Transfer of this precursor onto the nascent protein by OST
   - processing of the glycan in the Golgi apparatus
     - trimming and attachment of various sugar units

** Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation
- very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations
- consider in any unexplained clinical condition
  - particularly in multi-organ disease with neurological involvement
  - when non-specific developmental disability is the only presenting sign
- Incidence 1:50,000 to 100,000 births

** CDG classification
- Each CDG type is defined by a specific enzyme defect and the mutation in its underlying gene
- Most CDG mutations are hypomorphic - allow some glycan synthesis
- N-Glycan CDGs
  - Type 1: ER defects
  - Type 2: Golgi defects
  - ~1500+ cases worldwide
  - ~300+ cases in the US
    - 70% PMM2-CDG


* PMM2-CDG (CDG-Ia)

** Clinical Presentation
- ~70% CDGs
- The nervous system is affected in all patients
  - alternating internal strabismus and other abnormal eye movements
  - axial hypotonia, psychomotor disability, ataxia and hyporeflexia
- Other features are:
  - variable dysmorphism, which may include large ears, abnormal
    subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution, inverted nipples,
  - mild to moderate hepatomegaly, skeletal abnormalities and hypogonadism
- After infancy, symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa, stroke-like episodes, \pm epilepsy
- 1st year variable feeding problems anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea \to failure to thrive
- Some infants develop a pericardial effusion \pm cardiomyopathy
- At the other end of the clinical spectrum are patients with a very
  mild phenotype - no dysmorphic features, slight intellectual disability 

** Metabolic Derangement
- Deficiency of PMM2, principal isozyme of PMM
- Phosphomannomutase 2 catalyses the second committed step in the synthesis of GDP-mannose
  - Man-6-P \ce{<=>} Man-1-P, occurs in the cytosol
- GDP-mannose is used in the ER to assemble the dolichol-pyrophosphate
  oligosaccharide precursor
- defect \to hypoglycosylation
- deficiency and/or dysfunction of numerous glycoproteins, including:
  - serum proteins thyroxin-binding globulin, haptoglobin, clotting
    factor XI, antithrombin III, cholinesterase
  - lysosomal enzymes
  - membranous glycoproteins

** Genetics
- AR, PMM2
- \ge 107 mutations identified
- The most frequent mutation (c.422G>A) causes an R141H substitution
  - present in 75% of Caucasian patients
  - not compatible with life in the homozygous state
  - frequency in Belgian as high as 1 in 50
- The incidence of PMM2 deficiency is not known
  - in Sweden it has been estimated at 1 in 40,000

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow transaminases, hypoalbuminaemia, hypocholesterolaemia, and
  tubular proteinuria
- transferrin IEF
- To confirm the diagnosis, the activity of PMM should be measured in
  leukocytes or fibroblasts
  - [2-H^{3}]mannose-6-phosphate
- PMM activity in fibroblasts can be normal

** Treatment
- No effective treatment is available
- The promising finding that mannose is able to correct glycosylation
  in fibroblasts with PMM2 deficiency could not be substantiated in
  patients


* MPI-CDG (CDG-1b)
- Mannose-6 phosphate isomerase deficiency
- F-6-P \ce{<=>} M-6-P

- Prevalence: \lt 1/1,000,000
- AR, MPI
- onset in infancy, neonatal

- cyclic vomiting, profound hypoglycemia, failure to thrive, liver
  fibrosis, gastrointestinal complications
  - protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminaemia, life-threatening
    intestinal bleeding of diffuse origin
- thrombotic events protein C and S deficiency, low anti-thrombine III levels
- neurological development and cognitive capacity is usually normal
- *treated effectively with oral mannose supplementation*
- can be fatal if untreated
- Saquenay-Lac Saint-Jean syndrome
- Type I pattern, \downarrow MPI activity WBC, Fib

* Type II CDGs

** MGAT2-CDG (CDG-IIa)
- Golgi N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II deficiency
  - transfer GlcNAc \to free terminal mannose of core N-linked glycan chain
  - \to second branch in complex glycans
- AR, MGAT2
- Prevalence \lt1/1,000,000
- onset in infancy, neonatal
- facial dysmorphism: large, posteriorly rotated ears with prominent
  antihelices, convex nasal ridge, open mouth, large and crowded
  teeth
- stereotypic hand movements, seizures, and varying degrees of
  developmental delay.
- A bleeding tendency is also observed due to diminished platelet
  aggregation.
- Type II pattern, \downarrow GnT II activity WBC, Fib

** SLC35C1-CDG (CDG-IIc)
- GDP-fucose transporter 1	defect
- AR
- Normal transferrin IEF
- severe mental retardation, microcephaly, cortical atrophy, seizures,
  hypotonia, rhizomelic short stature, and recurrent infections with
  neutrophilia.
- *fucose has been used to treat*, thought that:
  - K_{M} mutants - treatable
  - V_{max} mutants - not treatable

* Laboratory Tests
** Transferrin IEF
- serum transferrin IEF is the screening method of choice

  - can detect nearly all known CDG-I types as well as most CDG-II types and many CDG-X cases.
  - N-glycosylation disorders associated with sialic acid deficiency

- Normal serum transferrin is mainly composed of:
  - tetrasialotransferrin and small amounts of mono-, di-, tri-,
    penta- and hex-asialotransferrins

- Partial deficiency of sialic acid (-ve charge) causes a
  cathodal shift.

- Two main types of cathodal shift can be recognized:
  - Type 1 or 2 patterns

- Type 1 pattern

  - \uparrow disialo- and asialotransferrin

  - \downarrow  tetra-, penta-and hexasialotransferrins

  - defects in the assembly of the dolichol lipid-linked
    oligosaccharide chain and transfer to the nascent protein
  - PMM2-CDG or MPI-CDG should be considered first

  - also seen in secondary glycosylation disorders such as:
    - chronic alcoholism, hereditary fructose intolerance and galactosaemia

- Type 2 pattern

  - Type 1 pattern with additional \uparrow tri- \pm
    monosialotransferrin bands.

  - defects in the trimming and processing of the protein-bound
    glycans either late in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi
    compartments.

** Transferrin IEF limitations

- deficiencies of ER-glucosidase I (CDG-IIb) and Golgi GDP-fucose
  transporter (CDG-IIc) are missed.
- prenatal diagnostics by IEF analysis from fetal blood is not
  reliable
- IEF of serum from children \lt 2 weeks may be false-positive
- Heavy alcohol consumption can also result in serum transferrin
  deficiency in carbohydrate moieties, leading to an abnormal
  IEF-pattern.
- Mutations in the protein backbone of transferrin
  - desialylation of transferrin by neuraminidase treatment or IEF of
    an alternative glycoprotein like \alpha 1-antitrypsin should be
    performed.

** Additional Laboratory Investigations

- Protein-linked glycan analysis can be performed to identify the defective step
  - MALDI-TOF analysis of released N-linked oligosaccharides
- CDG gene panel analysis or WES.

- Capillary zone electrophoresis of total serum is a rapid screening
  test for CDG.
  - An abnormal result should be further investigated by serum
    transferrin IEF.
