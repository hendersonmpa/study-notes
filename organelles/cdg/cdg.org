#+TITLE: Congenital Disorders of N-Linked Glycosylation
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- most extracellular proteins, membrane proteins and several
  intracellular proteins (lysosomal enzymes) are glycoproteins

- glycans are defined by their linkage to the protein:
  - N-glycans are linked to the amide group of asparagine
  - O-glycans are linked to the hydroxyl group of serine or
    threonine

- congenital disorders of glycosylation are due to defects in the
  synthesis of glycans and in the attachment of glycans to proteins
  and lipids
- rapidly growing disease family (N, O or GPI linked)
  - ~60 listed on NORD
  - ~1% of human genome involved in glycosylation

** Synthesis of N-glycans
1) formation in the cytosol of nucleotide-linked sugars
   - mainly GDP-Man, UDP-glc and UDP-glcNAC
   - attachment of glcNAc and Man units to dolichol phosphate
   - flipping into the ER
2) stepwise assembly in the ER
   - addition of manose and glucose \to 14-unit oligosaccharide precuror
     - dolichol pyrophosphate-glcNac_2-man_9-glu_3 (AKA: dolichol-P)
3) transfer of this precursor onto the nascent protein by
   oligosaccharyltransferase (OST)
   - processing of the glycan in the Golgi apparatus
     - trimming and attachment of various sugar units

** Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation
- very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations:
  - cerebellar hypotonia
  - hypoglycemia
  - psychomotor retardation
  - seizures
  - FTT
  - diarrhea
  - inverted nipples
- consider in any unexplained clinical condition
  - particularly in multi-organ disease with neurological involvement
  - when non-specific developmental disability is the only presenting sign
- incidence 1:50,000 to 100,000 births
- *NB:* O and GPI-linked CDGs not covered here
** CDG classification
- each CDG type is defined by a specific enzyme defect and the mutation in its underlying gene
- most CDG mutations are hypomorphic - allow some glycan synthesis
- N-Glycan CDGs
  - ~1500+ cases worldwide, 70% PMM2-CDG (CDG Ia)
    - Type 1 :: ER defects that impair lipid-linked oligosaccharide
      assembly and transfer
    - Type 2 :: Golgi defects that affect trimming of the
      protein-bound oligosaccharide or the addition of sugars to it

*** Treatable CDGs
 - CDG IB :: oral mannose
 - CDG IT :: oral galactose
 - CDG IIC :: oral frucose

* Type I CDGs
** CDG IA (PMM2-CDG)
*** Clinical Presentation
 - ~70% CDGs
 - nervous system is affected in all patients
   - global developmental delay
   - alternating internal strabismus and other abnormal eye movements
   - axial hypotonia, psychomotor disability, *ataxia* and hyporeflexia
 - other features are:
   - variable dysmorphism, which may include large ears, abnormal
     subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution, inverted nipples
   - mild to moderate hepatomegaly, skeletal abnormalities and hypogonadism
 - *cause of non-immune fetal hydrops*
 - after infancy symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa, stroke-like episodes \pm epilepsy
 - 1st year variable feeding problems anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea \to FTT
 - some infants develop a pericardial effusion \pm cardiomyopathy
 - other end of the clinical spectrum are patients with very mild
   phenotype - no dysmorphic features, slight intellectual disability

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - deficiency of *phosphomannomutase 2* principal isozyme of PMM
 - PMM2 catalyses the second committed step in the synthesis of GDP-mannose
   - occurs in the cytosol

   \ce{mannose-6-P <=>[PMM2] mannose-1-P}

 - GDP-mannose is used in the ER to assemble the dolichol-pyrophosphate
   oligosaccharide precursor
 - defect leads to hypoglycosylation
 - deficiency and/or dysfunction of numerous glycoproteins:
   - serum proteins:
     - thyroxin-binding globulin, haptoglobin, clotting factor XI,
       antithrombin III, cholinesterase
   - lysosomal enzymes
   - membrane bound glycoproteins

*** Genetics
 - AR PMM2

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - \uparrow transaminases
 - \downarrow albumin
 - \downarrow cholesterol
 - tubular proteinuria
 - transferrin IEF - Type I pattern
 - activity of PMM should be measured to confirm the diagnosis
   leukocytes or fibroblasts
   - [2-H^3]mannose-6-phosphate
   - PMM activity in fibroblasts can be normal
 - see figure [[fig:cdg_diag]]

*** Treatment
 - no effective treatment is available

** CDG IB (MPI-CDG)
 - AKA Saquenay-Lac Saint-Jean syndrome
*** Clinical Presentation
 - onset in neonatal \to infancy
 - cyclic vomiting, profound hypoglycemia, FTT, liver
   fibrosis, gastrointestinal complications
   - protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminaemia, life-threatening
     intestinal bleeding of diffuse origin
 - thrombotic events, protein C and S deficiency, low anti-thrombin III levels
 - neurological development and cognitive capacity is usually normal

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - *mannose-6 phosphate isomerase* deficiency

 \ce{fructose-6-P <=>[MPI] mannose-6-P}

*** Genetics
 - AR, MPI

*** Diagnostic Tests
 - serum transferrin IEF - Type I pattern 
 - \downarrow MPI activity WBC, fibroblasts
 - see figure [[fig:cdg_diag]]
*** Treatment
 - *treated effectively with oral mannose supplementation*
 - can be fatal if untreated

** CDG IC (ALGA6-CDG)
*** Clinical Presentation
- second most common CDG
- psychomotor retardation with delayed walking and speech, hypotonia,
   seizures, and sometimes protein-losing enteropathy
- clinical picture is milder than CDG-Ia
*** Metabolic Derangement
- *\alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase* deficiency 
- required for the attachment in the ER of the firstof three glucose
 molecules to the dolichol-linked mannose_{9}-N-acetylglucosamine_{2}
 intermediate
- causes hypoglycosylation of serum proteins
  - concentration of blood glycoproteins are very low as a result
*** Genetics 
- AR ALG6
*** Diagnostic Tests
- transferrin IEF - Type I pattern
- activity of PMM2 and MPI should be measured to rule out 
- molecular

*** Treatment
- none

** CDG IT (PGM1-CDG)
*** Clinical Presentation
- common features include cleft lip and bifid uvula, apparent at
  birth
- followed by hepatopathy, intermittent hypoglycemia, short stature,
  and exercise intolerance, often accompanied by increased serum
  creatine kinase
- less common features include rhabdomyolysis, dilated cardiomyopathy,
  and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism

*** Metabolic Derangement
- *phosphoglucomutase 1* deficiency

\ce{glucose-1-P <=>[PGM1] glucose-6-P}

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow transaminases
- transferrin IEF - *mixed Type I/II pattern*
- modified Beutler test using glucose-1-phosphate can be used to screen for PGM1 deficiency
- molecular

*** Treatment
- galactose supplementation may be an effective treatment

* Type II CDGs
** CDG IIa (MGAT2-CDG)
*** Clinical Presentation
- onset in infancy, neonatal
- facial dysmorphism: large, posteriorly rotated ears with prominent
  antihelices, convex nasal ridge, open mouth, large and crowded
  teeth
- stereotypic hand movements, seizures, and varying degrees of
  developmental delay
- bleeding tendency is also observed due to diminished platelet
  aggregation
