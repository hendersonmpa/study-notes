#+TITLE: Congenital Disorders of N-Linked Glycosylation
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- most extracellular proteins, membrane proteins and several
  intracellular proteins (lysosomal enzymes), are glycoproteins

- glycans are defined by their linkage to the protein:
  - N-glycans are linked to the amide group of asparagine
  - O-glycans are linked to the hydroxyl group of serine or
    threonine

- congenital disorders of glycosylation are due to defects in the
  synthesis of glycans and in the attachment of glycans to proteins
  and lipids
- rapidly growing disease family (N, O or GPI linked)
  - ~60 listed on NORD
  - 1% of HG involved in glycosylation

** Synthesis of N-glycans
1) formation in the cytosol of nucleotide-linked sugars
   - mainly GDP-Man, UDP-glc and UDP-glcNAC
   - attachment of glcNAc and Man units to dolichol phosphate
   - flipping into the ER
2) stepwise assembly in the ER
   - addition of manose and glucose \to 14-unit oligosaccharide precuror:
   - dolichol pyrophosphate-glcNac_2-man_9-glu_3
3) transfer of this precursor onto the nascent protein by OST
   - processing of the glycan in the Golgi apparatus
     - trimming and attachment of various sugar units

** Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation
- very broad spectrum of clinical manifestations
- consider in any unexplained clinical condition
  - particularly in multi-organ disease with neurological involvement
  - when non-specific developmental disability is the only presenting sign
- incidence 1:50,000 to 100,000 births
- *NB:* O and GPI-linked CDGs not covered here
** CDG classification
- each CDG type is defined by a specific enzyme defect and the mutation in its underlying gene
- most CDG mutations are hypomorphic - allow some glycan synthesis
- N-Glycan CDGs
  - Type 1: ER defects
  - Type 2: Golgi defects
  - ~1500+ cases worldwide
  - ~300+ cases in the US
    - 70% PMM2-CDG (CDG 1a)

* PMM2-CDG (CDG Ia)
** Clinical Presentation
- ~70% CDGs
- nervous system is affected in all patients
  - alternating internal strabismus and other abnormal eye movements
  - axial hypotonia, psychomotor disability, ataxia and hyporeflexia
- other features are:
  - variable dysmorphism, which may include large ears, abnormal
    subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution, inverted nipples,
  - mild to moderate hepatomegaly, skeletal abnormalities and hypogonadism
- cause of non-immune fetal hydrops
- after infancy, symptoms include retinitis pigmentosa, stroke-like episodes, \pm epilepsy
- 1st year variable feeding problems anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea \to failure to thrive
- some infants develop a pericardial effusion \pm cardiomyopathy
- at the other end of the clinical spectrum are patients with a very
  mild phenotype - no dysmorphic features, slight intellectual disability 

** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of PMM2, principal isozyme of PMM
- phosphomannomutase 2 catalyses the second committed step in the synthesis of GDP-mannose
  - man-6-P \ce{<=>} man-1-P
  - occurs in the cytosol
- GDP-mannose is used in the ER to assemble the dolichol-pyrophosphate
  oligosaccharide precursor
- defect leads to hypoglycosylation
- deficiency and/or dysfunction of numerous glycoproteins, including:
  - serum proteins:
    - thyroxin-binding globulin, haptoglobin, clotting factor XI,
      antithrombin III, cholinesterase
  - lysosomal enzymes
  - membranous glycoproteins

** Genetics
- AR, PMM2

** Diagnostic Testing
- \uparrow transaminases
- \downarrow albumine
- \downarrow hypocholesterol
- tubular proteinuria
- transferrin IEF - type I pattern
- confirm the diagnosis, the activity of PMM should be measured in
  leukocytes or fibroblasts
  - [2-H^3]mannose-6-phosphate
- PMM activity in fibroblasts can be normal

** Treatment
- no effective treatment is available

* MPI-CDG (CDG Ib)
** Clinical Presentation
- onset in infancy, neonatal
- cyclic vomiting, profound hypoglycemia, failure to thrive, liver
  fibrosis, gastrointestinal complications
  - protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminaemia, life-threatening
    intestinal bleeding of diffuse origin
- thrombotic events protein C and S deficiency, low anti-thrombine III levels
- neurological development and cognitive capacity is usually normal

** Metabolic Derangement
- mannose-6 phosphate isomerase deficiency
- F-6-P \ce{<=>} M-6-P

** Genetics
- AR, MPI

** Diagnostic Testing
- serum transferrin IEF - type I pattern 
- \downarrow MPI activity WBC, fibroblasts

** Treatment
- *treated effectively with oral mannose supplementation*
- can be fatal if untreated
- Saquenay-Lac Saint-Jean syndrome

* Type II CDGs
** MGAT2-CDG (CDG IIa)
*** Clinical Presentation
- onset in infancy, neonatal
- facial dysmorphism: large, posteriorly rotated ears with prominent
  antihelices, convex nasal ridge, open mouth, large and crowded
  teeth
- stereotypic hand movements, seizures, and varying degrees of
  developmental delay
- bleeding tendency is also observed due to diminished platelet
  aggregation

*** Metabolic Derangement
- golgi N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II deficiency
  - transfer glcNAc \to free terminal mannose of core N-linked glycan chain
  - \to second branch in complex glycans
*** Genetics
- AR MGAT2
*** Diagnostic Testing
- serum transferrin IEF - type II pattern
- \downarrow GnT II activity WBC, fibroblasts

*** Treatment 
- none
** SLC35C1-CDG (CDG IIc)
*** Clinical Presentation
- severe mental retardation, microcephaly, cortical atrophy, seizures,
  hypotonia, rhizomelic short stature, and recurrent infections with
  neutrophilia
- Bombay (hh) blood phenotype (Figure [[fig:hh]])
  - do not express H antigen 
*** Metabolic Derangement
- GDP-fucose transporter 1 defect
  - transports GDP-fucose into Golgi
*** Genetics
- AR SLC35C1

*** Diagnostic Testing
- normal transferrin IEF
- molecular
*** Treatment
- *fucose has been used to treat* thought that:
  - K_M mutants - treatable
  - V_{max} mutants - not treatable
