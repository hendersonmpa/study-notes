* Introduction
- rapidly progressive CNS degenerative disease
- Krabbe is both a *leukodystrophy* affecting white matter of the central
  and peripheral nervous systems, and an LSD
- incidence of 1:100,000 births
- deficiency in *galactocerebrosidase (AKA:galactosylceramidase)* 
  - catabolism of galactocerebroside, a major lipid in myelin, kidney, and epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon. 
  - results in accumulation of galactocerebroside in pathognomonic globoid cells
    - multinucleated microglia/macrophages seen in the white matter
- accumulation of psychosine (galactosylspingosine) in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells

- galactocerebrosidase is a lysosomal enzyme
- hydrolyzes the galactose ester bonds of galactocerebroside, galactosylsphingosine, lactosylceramide, and monogalactosyldiglyceride
- requires saposin A cofactor
- lysosomal trafficking of galactocerebrosidase by the M6P receptor
  - enzyme is secreted in ML II (I cell disease)

** Saposin A cofactor deficiency
- atypical Krabbe disease due to saposin A deficiency is caused by mutation in the prosaposin gene (PSAP)
- sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins A, B, C and D) are small
  homologous glycoproteins derived from a common precursor protein
  (prosaposin) encoded by a single gene
- they are required for /in vivo/ degradation of sphingolipids with
  short carbohydrate chains

* Clinical Findings
- Krabbe disease is a spectrum from infantile to late-onset

- *infantile-onset* (age <12 months)

  - normal development in the first few months followed by rapid
    severe neurologic deterioration
  - excessive crying to extreme irritability
  - feeding difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux disease
  - spasticity of lower extremities and fist clenching, with axial hypotonia
  - loss of acquired milestones: smiling, cooing, and head control
  - staring episodes
  - peripheral neuropathy
  - the average age of death is 2 years (8 months to 9 years)

- *later-onset* (age >12 months)
  - manifests after 12 months and as late as the seventh decade
  - slow development of motor milestones or loss of milestones
    - sitting without support, walking, slurred speech
  - spasticity of extremities with truncal hypotonia
  - vision loss, esotropia
  - seizures
  - peripheral neuropathy

- 85-90% of symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease diagnosed by
  enzyme activity alone have infantile-onset disease
  - 10-15% have later-onset disease
- NBS suggests that the proportion of individuals with later-onset
  Krabbe disease is higher than previously thought

* Genetics
- AR GALC
- recurrent 30 kb deletion extends from intron 10 to intron 17
  - infantile onset disease in homozygotes

* Diagnostic Tests
- diagnosis suspected in a symptomatic proband based on clinical
  findings and other supportive laboratory, neuroimaging, and
  electrophysiologic findings, is established by:
  - detection of deficient GALC enzyme activity in leukocytes
  - abnormal results require follow-up molecular genetic testing of GALC
  - elevated psychosine levels can also help establish the diagnosis

- in an asymptomatic newborn with low GALC enzyme activity on dried
  blood spot specimens on NBS urgent time-critical measurement of:
  - blood psychosine levels
  - GALC molecular genetic testing
  - necessary to identify, before age 14 days, newborns with evidence
    of infantile-onset Krabbe disease who are candidates for early
    HSCT

- \uparrow CSF protein
- leukocytes galactocerebrosidase activity 
  - 6-hexadecanoylamino-4-MU-\beta-d-galactopyranoside

- \uparrow DBS psychosine
  - an amphipathic lipid that partitions largely into cellular
    membranes
  - second-tier assay for infants with reduced galactocerebrosidase activity
  - diagnose and monitor patients with Krabbe disease and Saposin A
    cofactor deficiency

** Treatment
*** Treatment of manifestations
  - treatment of a child who is symptomatic before age six months is
    supportive and focused on increasing the quality of life and
    avoiding complications
  - older individuals treatment with HSCT is individualized based on
    disease burden and manifestations

*** Prevention of primary manifestations
  - asymptomatic newborns identified by either prenatal/neonatal
    evaluation because of a positive family history of Krabbe disease
    or an abnormal NBS result undergo additional testing to identify
    those with infantile-onset Krabbe disease
    - those with laboratory findings consistent with infantile-onset
      Krabbe disease are candidates for HSCT before age 30 days

*** Surveillance
  - monitor symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease for
    development of:
    - hydrocephalus, swallowing difficulties and chronic
      microaspiration, scoliosis, hip subluxation, and osteopenia,
      decreased vision, and corneal ulcerations
