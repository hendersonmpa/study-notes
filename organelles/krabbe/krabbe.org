* Introduction
- A rapidly progressive CNS degenerative disease
- Krabbe is both a leukodystrophy, affecting white matter of the central
  and peripheral nervous systems, and an LSD

- Incidence of 1:100,000 births
- Cause by deficiency in galactocerebrosidase activity
  - catabolism of galactosylceramide, a major lipid in myelin, kidney, and epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon. 
  - results in accumulation of galactosylceramide in pathognomonic globoid cells
    - Multinucleated microglia/macrophages seen in the white matter
- accumulation of galactosylspingosine (psychosine) in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells

- Galactocerebrosidase is a lysosomal enzyme
- Hydrolyzes the galactose ester bonds of galactocerebroside, galactosylsphingosine, lactosylceramide, and monogalactosyldiglyceride.
- Requires saposin A cofactor
- lysosomal trafficking of galactocerebrosidase by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor.
- enzyme is secreted in ML II 

** Saposin A cofactor deficiency

- atypical Krabbe disease due to saposin A deficiency is caused by mutation in the prosaposin gene (PSAP; 176801).
- Sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins A, B, C and D) are small
  homologous glycoproteins derived from a common precursor protein
  (prosaposin) encoded by a single gene.
- They are required for in vivo degradation of sphingolipids with short carbohydrate chains.
- probably act by isolating the lipid substrate from the membrane
  surroundings, thus making it more accessible to the soluble
  degradative enzyme

* Genetics
- Autosomal recessive
- The GALC gene is situated at 14q31 and consists of 17 exons.
- A recurrent 30 kb deletion has been described which extends from
  intron 10 to intron 17 of the GALC gene and in the homozygous state
  is associated with infantile onset disease.
- The allele frequency of this deletion in Krabbe patients is reported
  to be approximately 50% in Dutch patients and 35% in non-Dutch
  European patients

* Clinical Findings
** Disease Spectrum
- Krabbe disease is a spectrum from infantile to late-onset.

- Infantile-onset characterized by normal development in the first few
  months followed by rapid severe neurologic deterioration
  - the average age of death is 24 months (range 8 months to 9 years).

- later-onset disease manifests after 12 months and as late as the
  seventh decade.

- Historically 85%-90% of symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease
  diagnosed by enzyme activity alone have infantile-onset Krabbe
  disease and 10%-15% have later-onset Krabbe disease,

- NBS suggests that the proportion of individuals with later-onset
  Krabbe disease is higher than previously thought.

** Clinical Findings

*** Age <12 months (infantile-onset Krabbe disease)

- Excessive crying to extreme irritability
- Feeding difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Spasticity of lower extremities and fist clenching, with axial hypotonia
- Loss of acquired milestones (smiling, cooing, and head control)
- Staring episodes
- Peripheral neuropathy
- the average age of death is 24 months (range 8 months to 9 years).

*** Age >12 months (later-onset Krabbe disease)

- Slow development of motor milestones or loss of milestones (e.g.,
  sitting without support, walking), slurred speech
- Spasticity of extremities with truncal hypotonia
- Vision loss, esotropia
- Seizures
- Peripheral neuropathy

* Diagnosis
** Symptomatic presentation
- The diagnosis of Krabbe disease, suspected in a symptomatic proband
  based on clinical findings and other supportive laboratory,
  neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic findings, is established by:
  - detection of deficient GALC enzyme activity in leukocytes.
  - Abnormal results require follow-up molecular genetic testing of GALC
  - elevated psychosine levels can also help establish the diagnosis.

** Screen positive
- In an asymptomatic newborn with low GALC enzyme activity
  on dried blood spot specimens on NBS
- urgent time-critical measurement of:
  - blood psychosine levels
  - GALC molecular genetic testing
- is necessary to identify, before age 14 days, those newborns with
  evidence of infantile-onset Krabbe disease who are candidates for
  early HSCT

* Laboratory Investigations

** CSF protein
- protein in cerebrospinal fluid is elevated at the time of first symptoms
- with increased albumin and decrease in \beta-globulins
- Increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier?

** galactocerebrosidase assay

- HSC
- Leukocytes preferred
- Draw 5-6 mL of heparinized peripheral blood
- Fresh heparinized blood should be drawn early enough in the day to arrive in the laboratory by 3:00 p.m. that day
- Several of the assays available can be performed on a single leukocyte pellet or plasma sample

- cleavage of 6-hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-\beta-d-galactopyranoside
** Newborn Screening
*** New York State - retrospective analysis
- Almost 2 million infants screened.
- Five infants diagnosed with early infantile Krabbe disease.
- Three died, two from HSCT-related complications and one from untreated disease.
- Two children who received HSCT have moderate to severe developmental delays.
- Forty-six currently asymptomatic children are considered to be at
  moderate or high risk for development of later-onset Krabbe disease.


** Multiplex DBS  Enzyme Assay
- The DBS screening assay tests for:
  - Gaucher
  - Krabbe
  - Niemann-Pick-A/B
  - Pompe
  - Fabry
  - MPS-I
- a single 3-mm DBS punch, which is incubated in a single-assay
  cocktail with all substrates and internal standards.
- After incubation and liquid-liquid extraction, samples are analyzed by flow injection MS/MS.
- All deuterated internal standards correspond to enzymatically generated products.


** DBS Psychosine
- As an amphipathic molecule, psychosine partitions largely into
  cellular membranes.
- This test is used as a second-tier assay for infants who have
  abnormal newborn screens with reduced GALC (galactocerebrosidase)
  activity and to diagnose and monitor patients with Krabbe disease
  and Saposin A cofactor deficiency.

- psychosine is elevated in DBS samples of newborns with Krabbe.

- The original DBS specimens from the first four infantile
  KD cases identified through NBS had very elevated psychosine
  concentrations, whereas the psychosine levels of all of the
  asymptomatic high- and moderate-risk infants were only slightly
  elevated compared with DBS from infants with normal GALC activities.

** Treatment

*** Treatment of manifestations:
  - Treatment of a child who is symptomatic before age six months is
    supportive and focused on increasing the quality of life and
    avoiding complications. For older individuals, treatment with HSCT
    is individualized based on disease burden and manifestations.

*** Prevention of primary manifestations:
  - Consensus guidelines recommend that asymptomatic newborns
    identified by either prenatal/neonatal evaluation because of a
    positive family history of Krabbe disease or an abnormal NBS
    result undergo additional testing to identify those with
    infantile-onset Krabbe disease. Those with laboratory findings
    consistent with infantile-onset Krabbe disease are candidates for
    HSCT before age 30 days.

*** Surveillance:
  - Monitor symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease for
    development of: hydrocephalus, swallowing difficulties and chronic
    microaspiration, scoliosis, hip subluxation, and osteopenia,
    decreased vision, and corneal ulcerations.
