#+TITLE: Disorders of Sphingolipid Synthesis
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
** Sphingolipids
- Found in all mammalian cell membranes
- Plasma lipoproteins
- Structural role
- Modulate numerous biological functions
  - apoptosis
- named after the Sphinx because of their enigmatic nature...

** Sphingosine and Ceramide

- long chain sphingolipid base
- N-acylated by a variety of fatty acids

** Biosynthesis

*** ER
- condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA \to sphinganine
- N-acylation \to ceramide

*** Golgi
- stepwise addition of monosaccharides
  - sphingomyelin
  - glucosylceramide
  - glycosphingolipids
  - gangliosides

* Disorders of Sphingolipid Synthesis
** Classification

*** Primarily nervous system involvement
- Serine palmitoyltransferase - peripheral sensory neuropathy
- Ceramide synthase 1 - myoclonic epilepsy
- Ceramide synthase 2 - myoclonic epilepsy
- Fatty Acid 2-hydroxylase - SPG35
- Nonlysosomal β-Glucosidase - SPG46
- GM3 Synthase Deficiency - Amish infantile epilepsy
- GM2/GD2 Synthase Deficiency - SPG26

*** Primarily skin involvement
- Ceramide synthase 3 - Ichthyosis
- ULCFA \omega-hydrolase - Ichthyosis


** Serine Palmitoyltransferase (Subunit 1 or 2) Deficiency

- Defect in first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis 
- Major cause of dominant Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies (HSAN1).
  - Late onset (2-4th decade)
  - peripheral sensory neuropathy
  - distal sensory loss
  - ulcerative mutilations
  - hypohydrosis
  - there is a more severe early onset form
- Accumulation of sphingoid bases \to pathology
- mutations in serine palmitoyltransferase (SPCTLC1 or 2) alter
  substrate specificity
  - serine \to alanine and glycine
- Elevated plasma 1-deoxy-sphingamine, 1-deoxy-methyl-sphingamine, 1-deoxy-ceramindes
- Trial of serine supplementation

** Ceramide Synthases 1 and 2 

 - Six human ceramide synthases
   - tissue and acyl-CoA substrate specificity
   - Neurological CERS1 &2
     - CER1 :: Myoclonic epilepsy, cognitive decline
       - Decreased C18-ceramide in cultured fibroblasts
     - CER2 :: Myoclonic epilepsy
       - Decreased VLC-ceramide in cultured fibroblasts
   - Dermatologic CERS3
     - CER3 :: Ichthyosis
       - Lack of VLC-ceramides in skin and fibroblasts 

** Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylase

- spastic paraplegia
  - fatty acid hydroxylase associated neurodegeneration (FAHN)
- 38 patients, most in present in childhood
- slowly progressing
  - spastic paraplegia
  - dysarthria
  - mild cognitive decline
  - dystonia

- Insufficiency production of 2-hydroxy-galactosphingolipids
  - required in myelin
  - increase with brain development

- Decreased hydroxylated sphingomyelin in cultured cells

** GM3 Synthase Deficiency

- Autosomal recessive infantile-onset epilepsy
  - Amish epilepsy syndrome
- In first year \to generalized tonic-clonic seizures
  - profound developmental stagnation and regression
  - salt and pepper syndrome
    - hyper and hypo-pigmented skin maculae
    - facial dysmorphism scoliosis
    - intellectual disability
    - seizures
    - choreoathetosis
    - spasticity
    
- lack of GM3, GD3 and higher gangliosides, and increased
  lactosylceramide and Gb4 levels in plasma and cultured cells

** GM2/GD2 Synthase Deficiency

- Mutations of B4GALNT1
- SPG26, a slowly progressive complex hereditary spastic paraplegia
  with mild to moderate cognitive impairment.

- Cultured fibroblasts of patients have shown decreased GM2 levels
  with an increase of its precursor, GM3.

** Non-lysosomal β-Glucosidase Deficiency

- GBA2 is a membrane-associated protein localised at the ER and Golgi
  - hydrolyse glucosylceramide to ceramide and glucose.
- GBA2 is distinct from the lysosomal acid \beta-glucosidase GBA1 deficient in Gaucher disease
- hereditary (complex) spastic paraplegia locus SPG46.
- Starting in childhood marked spasticity in lower extremities with
  progressive gait disturbances
  - later, ataxia and other cerebellar signs

** Ceramide Synthase 3 and ULFA \omega-Hydroxylase

- ceramides in skin maintain skin barrier homeostasis, prevent water
  loss and protect against microbial infections
- Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a heterogeneous
  group of disorders of epidermal cornification
- 9 causative genes have been identified including CERS3 and CYP4F22 

- CERS3 :: ichthyosis
  - lack of ceramides with VLCFA in cultured fibroblasts
- CYP4F22 :: ichthyosis
  - lack of ceramides with ULCFA in cultured fibroblasts
