#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
** Sphingolipids
- found in all mammalian cell membranes
- plasma lipoproteins
- grey matter
- structural role
- modulate numerous biological functions
  - apoptosis
** Sphingosine and Ceramide
- long chain sphingolipid base
- N-acylated by a variety of fatty acids

** Biosynthesis
*** ER
- condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA \to sphinganine
- N-acylation \to ceramide

*** Golgi
- stepwise addition of monosaccharides
  - sphingomyelin
  - glucosylceramide
  - glycosphingolipids
  - gangliosides

* Disorders of Sphingolipid Synthesis
** Classification
*** Primarily nervous system involvement
- serine palmitoyltransferase :: peripheral sensory neuropathy
- ceramide synthase 1 :: myoclonic epilepsy
- ceramide synthase 2 :: myoclonic epilepsy
- fatty acid 2-hydroxylase :: spastic paraplegia
- non-lysosomal \beta-Glucosidase :: spastic paraplegia
- GM3 synthase deficiency :: amish infantile epilepsy
- GM2/GD2 synthase deficiency :: spastic paraplegia

*** Primarily skin involvement
- ceramide synthase 3 :: ichthyosis
- ULCFA \omega-hydrolase :: ichthyosis

** Serine Palmitoyltransferase (Subunit 1 or 2) Deficiency
- defect in first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis 
- major cause of dominant Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies (HSAN1)
  - late onset (2-4th decade)
  - peripheral sensory neuropathy
  - distal sensory loss
  - ulcerative mutilations
  - hypohydrosis
  - there is a more severe early onset form
- accumulation of sphingoid bases \to pathology
- mutations in serine palmitoyltransferase alter
  substrate specificity
  - serine \to alanine and glycine
- elevated plasma 1-deoxy-sphingamine, 1-deoxy-methyl-sphingamine, 1-deoxy-ceramindes
- trial of serine supplementation

** Ceramide Synthases 1 and 2 

 - six human ceramide synthases
   - tissue and acyl-CoA substrate specificity
   - neurological CERS1 &2
     - CER1 :: Myoclonic epilepsy, cognitive decline
       - decreased C18-ceramide in cultured fibroblasts
     - CER2 :: Myoclonic epilepsy
       - decreased VLC-ceramide in cultured fibroblasts
   - dermatologic CERS3
     - CER3 :: Ichthyosis
       - lack of VLC-ceramides in skin and fibroblasts 

** Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylase
- spastic paraplegia
  - fatty acid hydroxylase associated neurodegeneration (FAHN)
- 38 patients, most presented in childhood
- slowly progressing
  - spastic paraplegia
  - dysarthria
  - mild cognitive decline
  - dystonia

- insufficiency production of 2-hydroxy-galactosphingolipids
  - required in myelin
  - increase with brain development
- decreased hydroxylated sphingomyelin in cultured cells

** GM3 Synthase Deficiency
- autosomal recessive infantile-onset epilepsy
  - Amish epilepsy syndrome
- in first year \to generalized tonic-clonic seizures
  - profound developmental stagnation and regression
  - salt and pepper syndrome
    - hyper and hypo-pigmented skin maculae
    - facial dysmorphism scoliosis
    - intellectual disability
    - seizures
    - choreoathetosis
    - spasticity
- lack of GM3, GD3 and higher gangliosides, and increased
  lactosylceramide and Gb4 levels in plasma and cultured cells

** GM2/GD2 Synthase Deficiency
- slowly progressive complex hereditary spastic paraplegia
  with mild to moderate cognitive impairment
- cultured fibroblasts of patients have shown decreased GM2 levels
  with an increase of its precursor GM3
** Non-Lysosomal \beta-Glucosidase Deficiency
- GBA2 is a membrane-associated protein localised at the ER and Golgi
  - hydrolyse glucosylceramide to ceramide and glucose
- GBA2 is distinct from the lysosomal acid \beta-glucosidase GBA1 deficient in Gaucher disease
- hereditary (complex) spastic paraplegia
- starting in childhood marked spasticity in lower extremities with
  progressive gait disturbances
  - later, ataxia and other cerebellar signs

** Ceramide Synthase 3 and ULFA \omega-Hydroxylase
- ceramides in skin maintain skin barrier homeostasis, prevent water
  loss and protect against microbial infections
- autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a heterogeneous
  group of disorders of epidermal cornification
- 9 causative genes have been identified including CERS3 and CYP4F22 
  - CERS3 :: ichthyosis
    - lack of ceramides with VLCFA in cultured fibroblasts
  - CYP4F22 :: ichthyosis
    - lack of ceramides with ULCFA in cultured fibroblasts
