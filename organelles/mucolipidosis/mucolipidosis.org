* Introduction
- mucolipidoses derived their name from the similarity in
  presentation to both mucopolysaccharidoses and sphingolipidoses
- four conditions have been labelled as mucolipidoses:
  - ML I: sialidosis :: a glycoproteinosis
  - ML II: I-cell :: a glycoproteinosis
  - ML III: pseudo-Hurler polydystropy :: a glycoproteinosis
  - ML IV: ganglioside sialidase deficiency :: gangliosidosis

* ML I (Sialidosis)
** Clinical Presentation  
 - Type I sialidosis is the milder form of this disorder
   - the development of ocular cherry-red spots and generalized
     myoclonus in the second or third decade of life
   - \gt 50% of patients have seizures, hyperreflexia, and ataxia

 - Type II sialidosis early onset of a progressive, severe, MPS-like
   phenotype
   - visceromegaly, dysostosis multiplex, and mental retardation

** Metabolic Derangement
 - deficiency of \alpha-neuraminidase that normally cleaves terminal
   \alpha2 \to 3 and \alpha2 \to 6 sialyl linkages of several
   oligosaccharides and glycopeptides
 - found in increased amounts in tissues and fluids of affected patients

** Diagnostic Tests
 - test urine samples for both oligosaccharides and glycopeptides
 - definitive diagnosis - measurement of sialidase activity in fresh
   tissue samples, i.e., fibroblasts, cultured amniotic fluid cells,
   or white blood cells

** Treatment
 - supportive

* ML II & III 
- ML II AKA: I-Cell Disease
- ML III AKA: Pseudo-Hurler
** Clinical Presentation
*** ML II 
- low IQ
- short, max 75 cm by 2 y
- early coarse features
- gingival hypertrophy
- limited joint movement
- dysostosis multiplex
- minimal to no hepatomegaly and splenomegaly

*** ML III
- pathology of ML-III is not as well documented as that of ML-II
  - available data indicate the presence of similar but less severe
    findings
- ML-II and ML-III can be distinguished on clinical criteria and on
  progression of the disease


** Metabolic Derangement
- ML II and ML III result from a deficiency of the enzyme
  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase
  - \alpha\alpha\beta\beta\gamma\gamma-hexamer
  - phosphorylates target carbohydrate residues on N-linked
    glycoproteins
  - without this phosphorylation, the glycoproteins are not destined
    for lysosomes, and are secreted from the cell
  - ML II :: inactivity
  - ML III :: deficiency 

- characterized by deficient activity of a large number of lysosomal enzymes:
  - \beta-glucuronidase
  - \beta-galactosidase
  - \alpha-mannosidase
  - \alpha-fucosidase
  - N-acetyl-\beta-d-galactosiaminidase
  - arylsulfatase-A
  - glycosylasparaginase
- activities of the same lysosomal enzymes are high in the medium
  surrounding cultured I-cell fibroblasts

- I-cells are caused by oligosaccharides, lipids, and
  glycosaminoglycan inclusions in lysosomes

** Genetics
- AR GNPTAB

** Diagnostic Tests
- diagnosis is generally made by assay of lysosomal enzymes
  - \Downarrow in cultured fibroblasts 
  - \Uparrow in the plasma or serum
    - 10- to 20-fold increase in enzyme activity
- fibroblast or plasma glycosylasparaginase activity
- fibroblast or leukocytes GlcNAc phosphotransferase activity 

** Treatment
- supportive
* ML IV
** Clinical Presentation
  - severe motor developmental delay
  - iron deficiency anemia
  - corneal clouding
  - progressive retinal degeneration
  - achlorhydria
- notably absent are dysplastic bone abnormalities and enlargement of
  organs such as the liver and the spleen

** Metabolic Derangement
- inborn error of intracellular membrane trafficking due to mucolipin-1 deficiency
  - a transmembrane protein of the transient receptor potential channel family
  - unclear why  mucolipin-1 deficiency causes ML IV
- associated with lysosomal inclusions in a variety of cell types
** Genetics
- AR MCOLN1
** Diagnostic Tests 
- \uparrow blood gastrin levels
  - virtually diagnostic of ML IV given clinical presenation
- molecular

** Treatment 
- supportive
