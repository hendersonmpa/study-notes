* Introduction
- The mucolipidoses derived their name from the similarity in
  presentation to both mucopolysaccharidoses and sphingolipidoses.

- A biochemical understanding of these conditions has changed how they
  are classified.
- Four conditions (I, II, III, and IV) have been labeled as
  mucolipidoses:
  - ML I: sialidosis - a glycoproteinosis
  - ML II: I-cell - a glycoproteinosis
  - ML III: pseudo-Hurler polydystropy - a glycoproteinosis
  - ML IV: ganglioside sialidase deficiency - gangliosidosis

#+NAME: tab:mlnom
|                            | Current | Proposed          |
|----------------------------+---------+-------------------|
| I-cell                     | ML II   | ML II alpha/beta  |
| Pseudo-Hurler polydystropy | ML IIIA | ML III alpha/beta |
| ML III variant             | ML IIIC | ML III gamma      |

- ML II and ML III result from a deficiency of the enzyme
  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase
- phosphorylates target carbohydrate residues on N-linked
  glycoproteins
- Without this phosphorylation, the glycoproteins are not destined for
  lysosomes, and are secreted from the cell.

* ML II & III 
** Biochemical
- ML II and III are due to incorrect protein trafficking to lysosomes
- Characterized by deficient activity of a large number of lysosomal enzymes:
  - \beta-glucuronidase
  - \beta-galactosidase
  - \alpha-mannosidase
  - \alpha-fucosidase
  - N-acetyl-\beta-d-galactosiaminidase
  - arylsulfatase-A
  - glycosylasparaginase
- The activities of the same lysosomal enzymes are high in the medium
  surrounding cultured I-cell fibroblasts

- I-cells are caused by oligosaccharides, lipids, and
  glycosaminoglycan inclusions in lysosomes

** Clinical 

*** ML II
- Low IQ
- Short, max 75 cm by 2 y
- early coarse features
- gingival hypertrophy
- limited joint movement
- dysostosis multiplex
- minimal to no hepatomegaly and splenomegaly

*** ML III
- The pathology of ML-III is not as well documented as that of ML-II
- Available data indicate the presence of similar but less severe
  findings.

- ML-II and ML-III can be distinguished on clinical criteria and on progression of the disease

** Genetics

- Autosomal recessive
- The GlcNAc-PT has been purified and characterized as a hexameric
  (\alpha2\beta2\gamma2) protein,
  - a 540-KDa complex of disulfide linked homodimers
- the \alpha and \beta subunits are encoded as a single \alpha\beta polypeptide by the GNPTAB gene
  - subunits acquire molecular maturity following post-translational proteolysis of the initial gene product
  - \alpha\beta is the catalytic center in the GlcNAc-PT enzyme complex.
- Mutations in the GNPTAB gene cause ML II and ML IIIA
- Sequencing of the GNPTAB and GNPTG coding regions detects
  disease-causing mutations in over 95% of patients.
- Mutations in the GNPTG gene that encodes the \gamma subunit were
  first identified in a large Druze family in the Middle-East with a
  variant form of ML III, termed ML IIIC.


** Labs

- Diagnosis is generally made by assay of lysosomal enzymes
  - in cultured fibroblasts there is a distinct deficiency
  - in the plasma or serum where there is as much as a 10- to 20-fold increase in enzyme activity
- Assay of fibroblasts or plasma for glycosylasparaginase has been
  reported as useful for the diagnosis of I-cell disease.
- The diagnosis can also be made by assay of the GlcNAc
  phosphotransferase in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts


- Treatment is supportive

* Sialidosis and ML IV

** Sialidosis (ML I)
- Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder.

- *Type I sialidosis*, the milder form of this disorder, is
  characterized by the development of ocular cherry-red spots and
  generalized myoclonus in the second or third decade of life.
- Additional findings, reported in more than 50 percent of patients,
  include seizures, hyperreflexia, and ataxia.

- *Type II sialidosis* is distinguished from this milder form by the
  early onset of a progressive, rather severe,
  mucopolysaccharidosis-like phenotype with visceromegaly, dysostosis
  multiplex, and mental retardation.

- Both forms of the disease result from deficiency of the
  neuraminidase (NEU1) that normally cleaves terminal \alpha2 \to 3 and
  \alpha2 \to 6 sialyl linkages of several oligosaccharides and glycopeptides

- found in increased amounts in tissues and fluids of affected patients.

- Test urine samples for both oligosaccharides and glycopeptides

- definitive diagnosis - measurement of sialidase activity in fresh tissue
  samples, i.e., fibroblasts, cultured amniotic fluid cells, or white
  blood cells.

- supportive treatment

** ML IV

- autosomal recessive inborn error of intracellular membrane trafficking
  - associated with lysosomal inclusions in a variety of cell types.
  - mucolipin-1, a transmembrane protein of the transient receptor
    potential channel family, causes MLIV.
  - it is unclear why a deficiency or malfunction of mucolipin-1 causes MLIV.

- Clinical presentation includes:
  - severe motor developmental delay
  - iron deficiency anemia
  - corneal clouding
  - progressive retinal degeneration
  - achlorhydria.

- Notably absent are dysplastic bone abnormalities and enlargement of
  organs such as the liver and the spleen.

- blood gastrin levels should be measured, and elevated levels in
  this setting are virtually diagnostic of MLIV

- MLIV is pan-ethnic, but most patients are of Ashkenazi-Jewish
  ancestry, in which the most prevalent mutation occurs at a frequency
  of approximately 1/100.

- g.5534A \to G and g.511-6944del, are present in 95% of all
  Ashkenazi-Jewish patients. Population-based screening for these
  mutations is useful for the identification and counseling of MLIV
  carriers. Identification of mutations in MCOLN1 should be used for
  prenatal diagnosis.
