* Introduction
- intralysosomal cystine is formed by protein catabolism in the organelle

- normally exported by a cystine porter which contains the membrane protein cystinosin (Figure [[fig:lysexport]])
  - defects in cystinosin cause lysosomal accumulation of cystine
- cysteamine can enter into the lysosome and combine with cystine to form:
  - cysteine
    - exported by the cysteine porter
  - cysteine-cysteamine
    - exported by the lysine porter due to its structural analogy

- cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease classified into three
  clinical phenotypes:
  1) nephropathic or infantile - common form
  2) late-onset - rare milder form
  3) ocular - presence of cystine crystals in the eye and the bone
     marrow
- nephropathic or infantile form is by far the most frequent (Section [[Infantile Cystinosis]])
- late-onset or juvenile form and a benign or adult form are limited to the eyes
  - are caused by mutations of the same gene

* Infantile Cystinosis
** Clinical Presentation
*** First stage
    - 3-6 months symptom free
    - symptoms ~12 months
    - feeding difficulties, anorexia, vomiting, polyuria, constipation
    - rickets ~10-18 months
    - urine cloudy w glucose and protein \to Fanconi syndrome
    - normoglycemic glycosuria, generalized aminoaciduria, low
      molecular-weight proteinuria
      - \uparrow excretion of \beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme
      - \downarrow reabsorption of phosphate with hypophosphatemia
      - \uparrow losses of potassium, sodium and bicarbonate leading to
	hypokalemia, hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis
      - hypercalciuria may lead to nephrocalcinosis and hypouricemia is constant
      - tubular loss of carnitine may cause carnitine depletion
    - photophobia ~2-3 years
      - slit lamp reveals cystine crystals first year of life

*** End-stage renal failure
  - 6-12 years
  - delayed by cysteamine treatment 
*** Late symptoms
 - cystine accumulation affects:
   - eyes, liver, spleen, pancreas, muscle and CNS
*** Late Ocular Complications
 - corneal deposits accumulate progressively
 - photophobia, watering and blepharospasm may become disabling
   - photophobia may be prevented or cured by cysteamine eye drops

*** Endocrine Disturbances
 - hypothyroidism
 - gonadal function - azoospermic
 - endocrine pancreas - insulin dependant diabetes
 - hepatomegaly and splenomegaly
   - foam cells
 - myopathy
 - mild neurocognitive abnormalities

** Metabolic Derangement
- defect of cystinosin - transports cystine across the lysosomal
  membrane
- efflux of cystine out of cystinotic lysosomes is significantly
  decreased in comparison with normal lysosomes
- lysosomal cystine accumulation leads to cellular dysfunction in many
  tissues
  - kidney, bone marrow, conjunctiva, thyroid, muscle, choroid plexus,
    brain parenchyma and lymph nodes

** Genetics
- AR, CTNS

** Diagnostic Tests
- diagnosis of cystinosis is confirmed by:
  - leukocyte cystine levels (10-50 times normal values)
    - LC-MS/MS
  - corneal crystals on slit lamp examination
  - molecular analysis

** Treatment
*** Supportive
- treatment of tubular losses
- renal replacement therapy
- supportive treatment of extrarenal complications
*** Specific
- cysteamine
  - oral cysteamine bitartrate (cystagon)
  - cysteamine eye drops
