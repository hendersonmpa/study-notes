* Introduction
- intralysosomal cystine is formed by protein catabolism in the organelle
- normally exported by a cystine porter which contains a membrane protein, cystinosin
- defects of this protein cause lysosomal accumulation of cystine
- cysteamine can enter into the lysosome and combine with cystine
  - This results in the formation of cysteine which can be exported by the cysteine porter
  - the mixed disulfide, cysteine-cysteamine which can be exported by the lysine porter due to its structural analogy

- cystinosis is an autosomal-recessive generalized lysosomal storage
  disease classified into three clinical phenotypes:
  1) nephropathic or infantile - common form
  2) late-onset - rare milder form
  3) ocular - presence of cystine crystals in the eye and the bone
     marrow
- nephropathic or infantile form is by far the most frequent
- reported incidence of the disease is about 0,5–1:100,000 live births
- first symptoms start at about 6 months of age with anorexia,
  polyuria, failure to thrive and are secondary to a Fanconi proximal
  renal tubulopathy
- without treatment:
  - renal disease progress to end stage renal disease between 6 and 12 years
  - Survival beyond this age is associated with the development of
    extrarenal complications in eyes, thyroid, gonads, endocrine
    pancreas muscle and central nervous system
- late-onset or juvenile form and a benign or adult form are limited to the eyes
  - are caused by mutations of the same gene
- lysosomal cystine accumulation leads to cellular dysfunction in many organs
- disease is caused by mutations in CTNS coding for cystinosin, a
  lysosomal cystine/proton symporter
- diagnosis is ascertained by measurement of cystine in leukocytes
- treatment is both supportive and specific, the latter based on
  cysteamine, which effectively decreases intralysosomal cystine
  accumulation

* Infantile Cystinosis
** First stage
   - 3-6 months symptom free
   - symptoms @ 12 months
   - feeding difficulties, anorexia, vomiting, polyuria, constipation
   - rickets @ 10-18 months
   - urine cloudy w glucose and protein \to Fanconi syndrome
   - normoglycemic glycosuria, generalized aminoaciduria, low
     molecular-weight proteinuria
     - \uparrow excretion of \beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme
     - \downarrow reabsorption of phosphate with hypophosphatemia
     - \uparrow losses of potassium, sodium and bicarbonate leading to
       hypokalemia, hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis
     - Hypercalciuria may lead to nephrocalcinosis and hypouricemia is constant
     - Tubular loss of carnitine may cause carnitine depletion
   - photophobia @ 2-3 years
     - slit lamp reveals cystine crystals first year of life

** End-stage renal failure
 - 6-12 years
 - delayed by cysteamine treatment 
** Late symptoms
- cystine accumulation affects:
  - eyes, liver, spleen, pancreas, muscle and CNS
** Late Ocular Complications
- corneal deposits accumulate progressively in the stroma of the
  cornea and iris in all patients and on the surface of the anterior
  lens and retina in some
- photophobia, watering and blepharospasm may become disabling
  - photophobia may be prevented or cured by cysteamine eye drops

** Endocrine Disturbances

- hypothyroidism
- gonadal function - azoospermic
- endocrine pancreas - insulin dependant diabetes
- hepatomegaly and splenomegaly
  - foam cells
- myopathy
- mild neurocognitive abnormalities


** Metabolic Derangement
- defect of cystinosin, transports cystine across the lysosomal
  membrane
- efflux of cystine out of cystinotic lysosomes is significantly
  decreased in comparison with normal lysosomes
- cystine accumulates in many tissues including kidney, bone marrow,
  conjunctiva, thyroid, muscle, choroid plexus, brain parenchyma and
  lymph nodes
- cystine accumulation in proximal tubular cells /in vitro/ is
  associated with ATP depletion and inhibition of Na^+ dependent
  transporters

** Genetics
- AR, CTNS
- integral membrane protein with 7 membrane spanning domains and two
  lysosomal targeting signals
- 100 mutations in the first 10 exons and in the promotor of the gene
- most common is a 57 kb deletion - 76% of patients of European descent
  - deletion encompasses the CARKL gene, encoding the enzyme sedoheptulokinase
  - patients with homozygous 57kb deletion have elevated urinary sedoheptulose

** Diagnostic Tests

- diagnosis of cystinosis is confirmed by:
  - leukocyte cystine levels (10–50 times normal values)
    - LC-MS/MS
  - corneal crystals by the slit lamp examination
  - genetic analysis of CNTS

** Treatment
*** Supportive
- treatment of tubular losses
- renal replacement therapy
- supportive treatment of extrarenal complications
*** Specific
- cysteamine
  - oral cysteamine bitartrate (Cystagon)
  - cysteamine eye drops
