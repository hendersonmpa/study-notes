* Introduction
- Intralysosomal cystine is formed by protein catabolism in the organelle
- normally exported by a cystine porter which contains a membrane protein, cystinosin.
- Defects of this protein cause lysosomal accumulation of cystine.
- Cysteamine can enter into the lysosome and combine with cystine.
  - This results in the formation of cysteine which can be exported by the cysteine porter
  - the mixed disulfide, cysteine-cysteamine which can be exported by the lysine porter due to its structural analogy.

** Cystinosis

- Cystinosis is an autosomal-recessive generalized lysosomal storage disease classified into three clinical phenotypes:
  1) nephropathic or infantile
  2) late-onset
  3) ocular
- nephropathic or infantile form is by far the most frequent.
- The reported incidence of the disease is about 0,5â€“1:100,000 live births.
- The first symptoms start at about 6 months of age with anorexia,
  polyuria, failure to thrive and are secondary to a Fanconi proximal
  renal tubulopathy.
- Without treatment:
  - renal disease progress to end stage renal disease between 6 and 12 years.
  - Survival beyond this age is associated with the development of
    extrarenal complications in eyes, thyroid, gonads, endocrine
    pancreas muscle and central nervous system.
- late-onset or juvenile form and a benign or adult form are limited to the eyes
  - are caused by mutations of the same gene.
- The lysosomal cystine accumulation leads to cellular dysfunction in many organs.
- The disease is caused by mutations in CTNS coding for cystinosin, a lysosomal cystine/proton symporter
- The diagnosis is ascertained by measurement of cystine in leukocytes.
- Treatment is both supportive and specific, the latter based on
  cysteamine, which effectively decreases intralysosomal cystine
  accumulation.
