#+TITLE: Sphingolipid Degradation: GM1 Gangliosidosis
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- defect in *\beta-galactosidase (AKA: \beta-gangliosidase)*
  - removes galactose from GM1, keratin sulfate and some oligosaccharides (Figure [[fig:bgal]])
- *GM1 ganglioside accumulates in the brain and visera*
- infantile, juvenile and adult forms
  - correspond with amount of residual enzyme function
  - devastating degenerative disease
- GM1 gangliosidosis of all types is estimated to occur in 1:100,000 - 300,000
- GLB1-related disorders comprise two phenotypically distinct lysosomal storage disorders:
  1) GM1 gangliosidosis
  2) mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (Morquio B)
- MPS IVB - Morquio B
  - clinically indistinguishable from MPS IVA 
    - skeletal changes, including short stature and skeletal dysplasia
    - normal intelligence
  - prevalence of MPS IVB has been reported as 1:250,000 - 1,000,000

** Lysosomal multi-enzyme complex
- \beta-galactosidase forms a heterotrimeric complex with cathepsin A
  and neuraminidase
- \downarrow cathepsin A \to 2\degree  deficiency of neuraminidase
  - ML-1 (sialidosis) see Mucolipidosis

* Clinical Findings
- see table [[tab:gm1ss]]
- a cause of non-immune fetal hydrops

[fn:1] oligosacaride with terminal galactose
[fn:2] secondary to bony changes
[fn:3] FN have been observed
[fn:4] corneal clouding

* Genetics
- AR GLB1
- ~ 150 mutations in GLB1 have been described
- neither the type or location correlate with phenotype
* Laboratory Investigations
- \beta-galactosidase activity: leukocytes and DBS
  - 4-MU-\beta-d-galactopyranoside
- \uparrow urine oligosacarides with terminal galactose
- \uparrow urine keratin sulfate

* Treatment
- no curative treatment to date
