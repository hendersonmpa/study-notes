#+TITLE: Sphingolipid Degradation: GM1 Gangliosidosis
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today


* Introduction

- Defect in *\beta-galactosidase (AKA:\beta-gangliosidase)*
- *GM1 ganglioside accumulates in the brain and visera*
- *Infantile, juvenile and adult forms*
  - Residual enzyme function
  - Devastating degenerative disease
- GM1 gangliosidosis of all types is estimated to occur in 1:100,000 - 300,000

- GLB1-related disorders comprise two phenotypically distinct lysosomal storage disorders:
  1) GM1 gangliosidosis
  2) mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (Morquio B)

- MPS IVB - Morquio B
  - Clinically indistinguishable from MPS IVA 
    - skeletal changes, including short stature and skeletal dysplasia.
    - normal intelligence
  - The prevalence of MPS IVB has been reported as 1:250,000 - 1,000,000

** Lysosomal multi-enzyme complex

- \beta-galactosidase forms a heterotrimeric complex with:
  - cathepsin A/PPCA : CTSA 
  - neuraminidase: NEU1

- \downarrow cathepsin A \to 2\degree  deficiency of NEU1
  - ML-1 (sialidosis)

* Genetics
- GLB1: autosomal recessive 
- ~ 150 mutations in GLB1 have been described
- Neither the type or location correlate with phenotype

* Clinical Findings
