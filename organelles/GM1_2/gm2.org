#+TITLE: Sphingolipid Degradation: GM1/2 Gangliosidosis
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today


* Introduction
- Three genetic and biochemical subtypes
  - Tay-Sachs disease :: Hex A
  - Sandhoff disease :: Hex A&B
  - GM2 activator deficiency :: Activator
- Impaired lysosomal catabolism of GM2 ganglioside
- GM2 storage in neurons in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff
  - Sandhoff \uparrow asialo-GM2 in brain, globoside and oligosacarides in viseral organs
- Progressive cerebral degeneration
- Prior to population-based carrier screening the incidence of TSD was ~1:3600 Ashkenazi Jewish births.
  - Incidence of TSD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population in North America \downarrow > 90%
- Eastern Quebec founder mutation

| Disorder                     | Onset       | Death (y) | Enzyme    |
|------------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------|
| Tay-Sachs disease            | 3-6 months  |       2-4 | Hex A     |
| Juvenile GM 2 gangliosidosis | 2-6 years   |      5-15 | Hex A     |
| Adult GM 2 gangliosidosis    | 2 yrs-adult |  Variable | Hex A     |
|------------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------|
| Sandhoff disease             | 3-6 months  |       2-4 | Hex A&B   |
| AB variant                   | 3-6 months  |           | Activator |

- Functional lysosomal \beta-hexosaminidase enzymes are dimeric.
- Three isozymes are produced through the combination of \alpha
  and \beta subunits
- \beta-galactosidase, hexoaminidase A and B require the M6P-receptor
  - secreted in ML II (I cell disease)
- GM2 activator protein - sortilin

| Isozyme | Dimer composition | Function                                   |
|---------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| A       | \alpha/\beta      | hydrolyzes GM2 ganglioside                 |
| B       | \beta/\beta       | non-GM2 gangliosides w terminal hexosamine |
| S       | \alpha/\alpha     | no known physiological function            |

* Genetics
- HEXA, HEXB and GM2A: autosomal recessive
- > 130 mutations in HEXA
  - > 3 alleles comprise ~95% of Askenazi Jewish disease alleles
  - Good correlation with phenotype 
- > 40 mutations in HEXB
- 6 in GM2A

* Clinical Findings

| Onset of symptoms | <1 year           | 2-10 years         | 10+ years        |
| Eye findings      | CRS, blindness    | +/- CRS            |                  |
| movement          | weakness          | ataxia, dysarthria | dystonia, ataxia |
| Neurological      | startle response, | seizures           | psychosis        |

* Laboratory Investigations
- Urine oligosacarides
- /in vitro/ Hexoaminidase activity: leukocytes, fibroblasts
  - 4-MU-6-sulfo-\beta-glucosaminide
  - specific for the \alpha subunit

- ?Falsely normal results in Tay-Sachs female carriers?
- total hexosaminidases (A+B) using a synthetic fluorogenic substrate
  is straightforward and allows the diagnosis of Sandhoff disease.
- Differential assay of HexA using heat or acid
  inactivation does not identify patients with the B1 variant;
- the direct assay of hexosaminidase A using the sulfated synthetic
  substrate (4-MU-6-sulfo-β-glucosaminide) specific for the α-subunit
  is the method of choice.
- A high residual activity is found in Sandhoff disease,
  - excess of hexosaminidase S (αα-dimer).
- In GM2 activator deficiency, hexosaminidase A activity measured in
  vitro is normal;
- electron microscopic examination of a skin or conjunctival biopsy
  may provide strong evidence in favour of the diagnosis by
  demonstrating concentric lamellated bodies in nerve endings.
- The CSF shows increased levels of GM2.
- Definitive diagnosis requires GM2A sequencing
* Treatment
- treat seizures
- no curative treatment to date
- > 90% reduction in the disease in Jewish population
