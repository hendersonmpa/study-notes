#+TITLE: Niemann-Pick Disease A & B
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- Niemann-Pick Type A and B are caused by deficiency of *acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)*
  - acid sphingomyelinase is required to metabolize sphingomyelin
  - results in progressive *accumulation of sphingomyelin* in systemic organs
    - brain accumulation in neuronal forms
  - NPA & NPB represent opposite ends of a continuum
    - NPA :: \lt 1% of normal ASM
    - NPB :: ~ 10% of normal ASM
- lysosomal trafficking of acid sphingomyelinase is mediated by
  sortilin and MPR
  - MPR alone is sufficient to transport NPC2 to the endo/lysosomal compartment
- incidence of Niemann-Pick A among Ashkenazi Jews ~ 1:40,000
- incidence of both Niemann-Pick A and B in all other populations ~ 1:250,000

* Clinical Findings
** Niemann-Pick A symptoms
- fatal 1.5-3 years
- hepatosplenomegaly by age 3 months
- failure to thrive
- psychomotor regression at 1 year
  - progressive loss of mental and physical abilities
- interstitial lung disease resulting in lung infections and lung failure
- *cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (100%)*
** Niemann-Pick B symptoms
- normal intelligence and life-span
- symptoms outlined under NPA (but less severe)
- thrombocytopenia 
- short stature
- *cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (50%)*

* Genetics
- AR SMPD1
- good phenotype-genotype correlation
* Diagnostic Tests
- \Downarrow ASM activity in leukocytes or cultured cells
  - use of native or radio-labelled substrate preferred to fluorescent substrate
    - 6-hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-phosphorylcholine
      - does not detect Q292K mutation
- \uparrow chitotriosidase activity 
- \uparrow lyso-sphingomyelin in dried blood spots
- \uparrow plasma oxysterols
  - oxysterols cholestane-3\beta, 5\alpha, 6\beta-triol
  - 7-ketocholesterol
- atherogenic lipid profile 
  - \uparrow cholesterol
  - \uparrow LDL cholesterol
- foam cells in bone marrow (Figure [[fig:foam]])

* Treatment
- no approved treatments
- olipudase alfa - recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) ERT
  - treatment of nonneurologic manifestations
  - ongoing study to assessed safety and efficacy
