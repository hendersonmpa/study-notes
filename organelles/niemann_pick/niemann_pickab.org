#+TITLE: Niemann-Pick Disease A & B
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today


* Introduction
- There are two distinct diseases called Niemann-Pick
  - Types A and B (acid sphingomyelinase deficiency)
  - Type C (cholesterol recycling) - see section [[Niemann-Pick C]]

- Incidence of Niemann-Pick A among Ashkenazi Jews ~ 1:40,000.
- Incidence of both Niemann-Pick A and B in all other populations ~ 1:250,000.
- Niemann-Pick Type A and B are caused by deficiency of *acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)*
  - acid sphingomyelinase is required to metabolize sphingomyelin.
  - results in progressive *accumulation of sphingomyelin* in systemic organs
    - brain accumulation in neuronal forms
  - There is growing evidence that NPA & NPB represent opposite ends of a continuum.
    - NPA generally have little or no ASM production (less than 1% of normal).
    - NPB have approximately 10% of normal level of ASM.
- lysosomal trafficking of acid sphingomyelinase is mediated by sortilin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor.
- MPR alone is sufficient to transport NPC2 to the endo/lysosomal compartment

* Genetics
- Mutations in SMPD1
- Good phenotype-genotype correlation

* Clinical Findings
** Niemann-Pick A symptoms
- hepatosplenomegaly by age 3 months
- Failure to thrive
- Psychomotor regression at age 1
  - progressive loss of abilities â€“ mental and physical
- Interstitial lung disease resulting in lung infections and lung failure
- Cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (100%)

** Niemann-Pick B symptoms
- Symptoms outlined under NPA (but less severe)
- Thrombocytopenia 
- Short stature
- Cherry-red spot identified with eye examination (50%)
- Classification by neurological form is widely used
- correlation between age at neurological onset and course of disease
  and lifespan has been established



* Diagnostic Tests
- Plasma oxysterols
  - oxysterols cholestane-3\beta, 5\alpha, 6\beta-triol
  - 7-ketocholesterol
  - Chitotriosidase is moderately elevated
- Deficient ASM activity in leukocytes or cultured cells.
  - use of native or radio-labelled substrate preferred to fluorescent substrate
    - 6-hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-phosphorylcholine
    - Does not detect Q292K mutation

* Treatment
- No approved treatments
- Olipudase alfa, a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (ASM),
  - an ERT for the treatment of nonneurologic manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD).
- ongoing, open-label, long-term study assessed safety and efficacy of olipudase alfa 
- Chitotriosidase in serum and lyso-sphingomyelin in dried blood spots
  decreased with olipudase alfa treatment
