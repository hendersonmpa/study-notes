* Introduction
- a fatal, neuro-degenerative disease that affects ~ 1:150,000
  - sometimes referred to as Childhood Alzheimerâ€™s
  - extremely heterogeneous
  - biochemically, genetically and clinically distinct from Niemann-Pick A and B. 
- Accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycolipids in systemic organs
- GM2 and GM3 accumulate in brain
  - no increase in cholesterol
- NPC has two sub types NP-C1 (95%) and NP-C2 (5%)

- LDL cholesterol enters cells via endocytosis at the LDL receptor.
- delivered to the late-stage endosomes and lysosomes
- hydrolyzed and released as free cholesterol.
- Unesterified cholesterol is transported to the plasma membrane and the ER for recycling.

- In NP-C, the LDL-cholesterol is trapped in lysosomes

- NPC1 is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in transport in the endosomal-lysosomal system
- NPC2 acts in cooperation with the NPC1
- The disruption of transport results in accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes.

* Genetics
- Autosomal recessive inheritance,
- Mutations in NPC1 (95%) and NPC2 (5%)

* Clinical Findings
- onset of the disease can happen at any age.
  - often school age children.
  - also adults

- Symptoms may include:
  - Jaundice at birth or shortly afterwards
  - Hepatosplenomegaly
  - Vertical supranuclear gaze palzy
  - Ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia
  - Cognitive dysfunction/dementia
  - Cataplexy, tremors,Seizures


*** Definitions:
- Vertical Supranuclear Gaze Palzy: Difficulty with Upward & Downward Eye Movement 
- Ataxia: Unsteadiness with Gait, Clumsiness or Walking 
- Dystonia:  neurological movement disorder syndrome in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures
- Dysarthria: Slurred Irregular Speech 
- Cognitive Dysfunction/Dementia: Learning Difficulties & Progressive Intellectual Decline 
- Cataplexy: Sudden Loss of Muscle Tone Which May Lead to Unexpected Falls 
- Dysphagia:Swallowing Problems 
- Thrombocytopenia: low number of platelets

** Neurological Forms
*** Early infantile          
- pre-existing hepatosplenomegaly
- delay in motor milestones 9m-2yrs
- survival <6 years

*** Late-infantile
- classic NPC, 60-70% of cases
- language delay
- Ataxia, 3-5 yrs
- Cognitive dysfunction, 6-12 yrs 

*** Adult 
- diagnosis 15->60yrs.
- insidious presentation
- ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria, movement disorders
- variable cognitive dysfunction
- Vertical gaze palzy common

* Diagnostic Tests

- Foamy and sea-blue histiocytes may (not always) be found in bone
  marrow aspirates.

- Plasma and DBS
  - lysosphingomylin 
  - lysosphingomylin-509


- Filipin test
  - Streptomyces filipinensis - anti-fungal
  - culture fibroblasts in an LDL-enriched medium
  - pathognomonic free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes
  - fluorescence microscopy after filipin staining
  - unequivocal results in ~ 85% of patients

* Treatment
- substrate reduction therapy
  - miglustat approved for treatment of neurological manifestations
  - miglustat is an iminosugar, a synthetic analogue of D-glucose
