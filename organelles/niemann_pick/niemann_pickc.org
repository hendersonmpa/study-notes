* Introduction
- a fatal, neuro-degenerative disease that affects ~ 1:150,000
  - sometimes referred to as childhood Alzheimerâ€™s
  - extremely heterogeneous
  - biochemically, genetically and clinically distinct from Niemann-Pick A and B 
- accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycolipids in systemic organs
- GM2 and GM3 accumulate in brain
  - no increase in cholesterol
- NPC has two sub types NP-C1 (95%) and NP-C2 (5%)

- LDL cholesterol enters cells via endocytosis at the LDL receptor
- delivered to the late-stage endosomes and lysosomes
- hydrolyzed and released as free cholesterol
- unesterified cholesterol is transported to the plasma membrane and the ER for recycling

- in NP-C the LDL-cholesterol is trapped in lysosomes

- NPC1 is a lysosomal membrane protein involved in transport in the endosomal-lysosomal system
- NPC2 acts in cooperation with the NPC1
- disruption of transport results in accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes

* Genetics
- AR NPC1 (95%) and NPC2 (5%)

* Clinical Findings
- onset of the disease can happen at any age
  - often school age children
  - also adults

- symptoms may include:
  - jaundice at birth or shortly afterwards
  - hepatosplenomegaly
  - vertical supranuclear gaze palzy
  - ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia
  - cognitive dysfunction/dementia
  - cataplexy, tremors, seizures
    
** Neurological Forms
*** Early Infantile          
- pre-existing hepatosplenomegaly
- delay in motor milestones 9m-2yrs
- survival <6 years

*** Late Infantile
- classic NPC 60-70% of cases
- language delay
- ataxia 3-5 yrs
- cognitive dysfunction 6-12 yrs 

*** Adult 
- diagnosis 15->60yrs
- insidious presentation
- ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria, movement disorders
- variable cognitive dysfunction
- vertical gaze palzy common

* Diagnostic Tests
- foamy and sea-blue histiocytes may be found in bone marrow aspirates
- plasma and DBS
  - lysosphingomylin 
  - lysosphingomylin-509


- filipin test
  - streptomyces filipinensis - anti-fungal
  - culture fibroblasts in an LDL-enriched medium
  - pathognomonic free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes
  - fluorescence microscopy after filipin staining
  - unequivocal results in ~ 85% of patients

* Treatment
- substrate reduction therapy
  - miglustat approved for treatment of neurological manifestations
  - miglustat is an iminosugar, a synthetic analogue of D-glucose
