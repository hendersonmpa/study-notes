* Introduction
- *arylsulfatase A deficiency*
  - block in lysosomal degradation of sulfatide (AKA: sulfated
    galactocerebroside) and other sulfated glycolipids
  - sulfatide is presented to the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ASA) as a
    1:1 complex with sap-B
  - deficiency of either ASA or sap-B can cause MLD
  - MPR required for lysosomal trafficking
- metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) incidence between 1:40,000 and 1:170,000
  - specific ethnic groups with higher frequency

- sulfatide is component of the myelin sheath
- sulfatide:galactocerebroside ratio \to stability and physiological properties of this membrane
- \uparrow sulfatides in CNS and PNS \to demyelination
- \uparrow sulfatide in the kidney \to sulfatide in urine

* Genetics
- AR ARSA or PSAP (sap-B)
- relatively good genotype-phenotype correlation
- two very frequent ARSA polymorphisms 
  - loss of an N-glycosylation site
  - loss of a polyadenylation signal
- result in reduction of the amount of enzyme and constitute the
  molecular basis of *ASA pseudodeficiency*

* Clinical 
- three forms: late infantile-onset, juvenile and adult
- variants include:
  - saposin B deficiency
  - multiple sulphatase deficiency (see Section [[Mucopolysaccharidoses]])
** Late-infantile
- onset 1-2 years
- typical presenting findings include weakness, hypotonia, clumsiness, frequent falls, toe walking, and dysarthria
- language, cognitive, and gross and fine motor skills regress
- later signs include spasticity, pain, seizures, and compromised vision and hearing
- final stages, children have tonic spasms, decerebrate posturing, and
  general unawareness of their surroundings

** Juvenile 
- onset 6-8 years
- decline in school performance and emergence of behavioral problems, followed by gait disturbances
- progression is similar to but slower than in the late-infantile form

** Adult
- onset occurs \gt 16 years, sometimes not until the fourth or fifth decade
- problems in school or job performance, personality changes, emotional lability, or psychosis
- neurologic symptoms (weakness and loss of coordination progressing
  to spasticity and incontinence) or seizures initially
  predominate
- peripheral neuropathy is common
- disease course is variable,periods of stability and decline two to three decades
- final stage is similar to earlier-onset forms

* Diagnosis

- ASA activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts
  - p-nitrocatechol-sulfate 
- pseudodeficiency is a major pitfall
  - homozygotes for a pd allele (1-2% of the European population)
  - compound heterozygotes for a disease-causing MLD and a PD allele
    have about 5-15% of normal ASA activity
    - no detectable clinical abnormality or pathology
- deficient ASA activity is not diagnostic
- sulfatides in the urinary sediment circumvents the problem
- MLD and MSD patients excrete sulfatides
  - \Uparrow late infantile and juvenile patients 
  - \uparrow adult-onset type
  - within or slightly above the normal range in PD
- prenatal testing of MLD by DNA analysis is preferred
- another cause of erroneous interpretation of an ASA deficiency is
  *multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD)* due to a deficiency in the
  formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE)encoded by SUMF1
- *whenever a deficiency of one sulfatase is found, it is mandatory to*
  *systematically measure the activity of another one to exclude MSD*
  - arylsulfatase B or iduronate-2-sulfatase
- MLD patients with sap-B deficiency
  - /in vitro/ ASA assay will not show a deficiency
  - sulfatides and globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in urine are essential
    - both lipids are elevated *combined MLD and Fabry pattern*
  - diagnosis requires PSAP molecular genetics
* Treatment
- HSCT has been used
- lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy tested
- clinical trial of intrathecal administration of rhASA is ongoing
