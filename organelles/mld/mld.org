* Introduction

- metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is panethnic, with reported
  incidences ranging between 1 in 40,000 and 1 in 170,000, except in
  specific ethnic groups with higher frequency
  - block in lysosomal degradation of sulfatide (AKA sulfated
    galactocerebroside) and other sulfated glycolipids
  - sulfatide is presented to the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ASA) as a
    1:1 complex with sap-B
  - A deficiency of either ASA or sap-B can cause MLD
- sulfatide is component of the myelin sheath
- sulfatide:galactocerebroside ratio \to stability and physiological properties of this membrane
- \uparrow sulfatides in CNS and PNS \to demyelination
- \uparrow sulfatide in the kidney \to sulfatide in urine

- three forms:
  1) late infantile
  2) juvenille
  3) adult


* Genetics
- 200 different ARSA mutations
- 3 frequent in europeans:
  - c.465+1G>A severe phenotype
  - p.Pro428Leu mild phenotype
  - Ile181Ser mild phenotype
- relatively good genotype-phenotype correlation
- two very frequent ARSA polymorphisms:
  1. loss of an N-glycosylation site
  2. loss of a polyadenylation signal

- PSAP , sap-B
- result in reduction of the amount of enzyme and constitute the molecular basis of ASA pseudodeficiency
- MLD due to sap-B deficiency is pan ethnic, PSAP

* Clinical 
** Late-infantile MLD
- onset is before age 30 months
- typical presenting findings include weakness, hypotonia, clumsiness, frequent falls, toe walking, and dysarthria
- language, cognitive, and gross and fine motor skills regress
- later signs include spasticity, pain, seizures, and compromised vision and hearing
- final stages, children have tonic spasms, decerebrate posturing, and
  general unawareness of their surroundings

** Juvenile MLD
- onset is between age 30 months and 16 years
- decline in school performance and emergence of behavioral problems, followed by gait disturbances
- progression is similar to but slower than in the late-infantile form

** Adult MLD
- onset occurs after age 16 years, sometimes not until the fourth or fifth decade
- problems in school or job performance, personality changes, emotional lability, or psychosis
- neurologic symptoms (weakness and loss of coordination progressing
  to spasticity and incontinence) or seizures initially
  predominate
- peripheral neuropathy is common
- disease course is variable – periods of stability and decline – two to three decades
- final stage is similar to earlier-onset forms

* Diagnosis

- ASA activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts using p-nitrocatechol-sulfate is the first first biochemical test
- pseudodeficiency is a major pitfall
  - homozygotes for a pd allele (1-2% of the European population)
  - compound heterozygotes for a disease-causing mld and a pd allele
    have about 5-15% of normal ASA activity but no detectable clinical
    abnormality or pathology
- deficient ASA activity is not diagnostic
- sulfatides in the urinary sediment circumvents the problem
- MLD and multiple sulfatase deficiency patients excrete sulfatides
  - \Uparrow late infantile and juvenile patients 
  - \uparrow adult-onset type
  - ASA within or slightly above the normal range

- prenatal testing of MLD by DNA analysis is preferred

- another cause of erroneous interpretation of an ASA deficiency is
  *multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD)*, due to a deficiency in the
  formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE)encoded by SUMF1

- *whenever a deficiency of one sulfatase is found, it is mandatory to*
  *systematically measure the activity of another one to exclude MSD*
  - arylsulfatase B or iduronate-2-sulfatase
- the clinical picture can be misleading

- MLD patients with sap-B deficiency
  - the in vitro ASA assay will not show a deficiency
  - sulfatides and globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in urine are essential
  - both lipids are elevated - combined MLD and Fabry pattern
- diagnosis requires PSAP molecular genetics
* Treatment
- HSCT has been used
- lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy tested
- clinical trial of intrathecal administration of rhASA is ongoing
