* Introduction

- Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is panethnic, with reported
  incidences ranging between 1 in 40,000 and 1 in 170,000, except in
  specific ethnic groups with higher frequency.
  - block in lysosomal degradation of sulfatide AKA sulfated galactocerebroside, and other sulfated glycolipids.
  - sulfatide is presented to the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ASA) as a
    1:1 complex with sap-B
  - A deficiency of either ASA or sap-B can cause MLD.
- Sulfatide is component of the myelin sheath.
- sulfatide:galactocerebroside ratio \to stability and physiological properties of this membrane.
- \uparrow sulfatides in CNS and PNS \to demyelination.
- \uparrow sulfatide in the kidney \to sulfatide in urine

- Three forms:
  1) Late Infantile
  2) Juvenille
  3) Adult


* Genetics
- 200 different ARSA mutations
- 3 frequent in europeans:
  - c.465+1G>A severe phenotype
  - p.Pro428Leu mild phenotype
  - Ile181Ser mild phenotype
- relatively good genotype-phenotype correlation
- Two very frequent ARSA polymorphisms:
  1. loss of an N-glycosylation site
  2. loss of a polyadenylation signal

- PSAP , sap-B
- result in reduction of the amount of enzyme and constitute the molecular basis of ASA pseudodeficiency
- MLD due to sap-B deficiency is pan ethnic, PSAP

* Clinical 
** Late-infantile MLD
- Onset is before age 30 months.
- Typical presenting findings include weakness, hypotonia, clumsiness, frequent falls, toe walking, and dysarthria.
- language, cognitive, and gross and fine motor skills regress.
- Later signs include spasticity, pain, seizures, and compromised vision and hearing.
- final stages, children have tonic spasms, decerebrate posturing, and
  general unawareness of their surroundings

** Juvenile MLD
- Onset is between age 30 months and 16 years.
- decline in school performance and emergence of behavioral problems, followed by gait disturbances.
- Progression is similar to but slower than in the late-infantile form.

** Adult MLD
- Onset occurs after age 16 years, sometimes not until the fourth or fifth decade.
- problems in school or job performance, personality changes, emotional lability, or psychosis
- neurologic symptoms (weakness and loss of coordination progressing
  to spasticity and incontinence) or seizures initially
  predominate.
- Peripheral neuropathy is common.
- Disease course is variable – periods of stability and decline – two to three decades.
- The final stage is similar to earlier-onset forms.

* Diagnosis

- ASA activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts using p-nitrocatechol-sulfate is the first first biochemical test.
- Pseudodeficiency is a major pitfall.
  - homozygotes for a pd allele (1–2% of the European population)
  - compound heterozygotes for a disease-causing mld and a pd allele
    have about 5–15% of normal ASA activity but no detectable clinical
    abnormality or pathology.
- Deficient ASA activity is not diagnostic
- sulfatides in the urinary sediment circumvents the problem.
- MLD and multiple sulfatase deficiency patients excrete sulfatides
  - massive - late infantile and juvenile patients 
  - significant adult-onset type
  - ASA pd within or slightly above the normal range.
  - 
- Prenatal testing of MLD by DNA analysis is preferred

- Another cause of erroneous interpretation of an ASA
deficiency is multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), due to a
deficiency in the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE)
encoded by SUMF1. 

- Whenever a deficiency of one sulfatase is found, it is mandatory to
  systematically measure the activity of another one to exclude MSD
  - arylsulfatase B or iduronate-2-sulfatase
- the clinical picture can be misleading

- MLD patients with sap-B deficiency
  - the in vitro ASA assay will not show a deficiency.
  - sulfatides and globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in urine are essential.
  - Both lipids are elevated - combined MLD and Fabry pattern
- diagnosis requires PSAP molecular genetics
* Treatment
- HSCT has been used
- lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy tested
- clinical trial of intrathecal administration of rhASA is ongoing
