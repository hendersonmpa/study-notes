#+TITLE: Sphingolipid Degradation: Fabry
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB

* Introduction
- AKA: angiokeratoma corporis diffusum universale
- second most common LSD
- 1:340,000 heterozygote females in the UK
- first described in 1898 independently by Anderson and Fabry
  - Dermatologists
- defect in \alpha-galactosidase A (ceramide trihexosidase)
  - inability to cleave terminal galactose from the sphingolipid globotriaosylceramide Gb3 (galactosylgalactosylglucoceramide)
  - 3 to 20% activity in hemizygote males
- lack of \alpha-GalA leads to accumulation of Gb3 in blood vessels and other tissues
  - wide range of symptoms including kidney, heart, and skin symptoms
  - \uparrow [Gb3] in kidney and blood group B antigenic glycosphingolipid
-  globotriaosylceramide (Gb3): the Fabry lipid
- \alpha-galactosidase A uses both sortilin and mannose receptor
  - not affected in ML II & III

* Genetics
- \alpha-galactosidase A gene is on the X chromosome
  - Xq22.1
- X-linked with penetrance in female heterozygotes
  - may be considered X-linked dominant
- \gt 300 of mutations have been found
- single nucleotide missense mutations identified in the majority of families
  - mostly private mutations

* Clinical Findings

- postprandial pain or diarrhea
  - may be sole complaint
- degradation of interphalangeal joints
- cerebrovascular - stroke, seizures
- ocular lesions
- angiokeratomas
  - prominent on hip, buttocks and scrotum

| Age         | Signs                                           |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Childhood   | Pain in extremities, fever, Fabry crisis [fn:1] |
| Adolescence | Angiokeratomas                                  |
| Adulthood   | Central nervous system symptoms                 |
|             | Myocardial and pulmonary disease                |
| Middle age  | Renal failure, lymphedema                       |

[fn:1] May be induced by heat, cold, fatigue or emotional stress

* Laboratory Investigations
** Biochemistry
- deficient \alpha-galactosidase A activity in leukocytes
  - fluorometric 4MU-\alpha-D-galactopyranoside substrate
  - LC-MS/MS 
- NBS via \alpha-galactosidase A activity in DBS
  - Taiwan, MO, IL
- elevated urine Gb3 and Gb2 in hemizygote males and heterozygote females
  - urine and DUS LC-MSMS assay
- plasma lyso-Gb3 (globotriaosylsphingosine) is a sensitive biomarker
  - LC-MSMS
  - useful in diagnosis and monitoring

** Pathology
- widespread deposition of Gb3
- vacuoles seen in variety of cells, \uparrow endothelium of blood vessels

* Treatment
- alleviate pain
  - chronic low dose of diphenylhydantoin
  - carbamazapine, gabapentin
- dialysis or renal transplantation
- there is long term experience with ERT
  - Agalsidase (alpha or beta)
  - reduces left ventricular hypertrophy
  - less effect on renal function
  - does not prevent progression
- oral chaperone therapy - migalastat
  - only for amenable mutations
