#+TITLE: Sphingolipid Degradation: Gaucher
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- defect in *\beta-glucocerebrosidase (AKA: acid \beta-glucosidase)*
  - extremely rare *SAP-C deficiency*
- located in the lumen of lysosomes
- LIMP-2 is responsible for MPR independent lysosomal targeting of
  \beta-glucocerebrosidase
- caused by accumulation of *glucocerebroside* the Gaucher lipid
- most common LSD
  - 1:40,000 to 1:50,000 live births
- three types:
  - Type 1 :: no neurological symptoms
  - Type 2 :: acute neuronopathic
  - Type 3 :: sub-acute or chronic neuronopathic
- Type 1 disease is common in Western Europe, the Americas and Israel
- in many other countries neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease predominate

* Genetics
- AR GBA 
- most of the >300 disease alleles in Gaucher disease are missense
  mutations
  - result in \beta-glucocerebrosidase with decreased catalytic
    function and/or stability
- genotype/phenotype correlations exist for:
  - type 1 disease (N370S)
  - types 2 and 3 (L444P)
- within these categories there is variable penetrance and
  expressivity between individuals and ethnic groups

* Clinical Findings

** Gaucher type 1
- no neurological symptoms
- clinical manifestations of Gaucher type 1 are linked to macrophages
  engorged with glucosylceramide

- an undefined mechanism results in:
  - enlargement and dysfunction of the liver and spleen
  - displacement of normal bone marrow by storage cells
  - osteoclastic-osteoblastic imbalances
    - subsequent damage leading to bone infarctions and fractures
  - occasionally, involvement of other organs (e.g. lung) contributes
    to the overall clinical picture
  - hypermetabolism and cachexia can be present
  - thrombocytopenia is the most common peripheral blood abnormality 
  - a high incidence of Parkinsonism
  - spinal cord and nerve root compression

** Gaucher type 2
- acute neuronopathic
- type 2 is the rarer of the two classic neuronopathic variants
- early infantile onset of acute neuronopathic disease
- progressing rapidly to death before age 2 years
  - retroflexion of the neck
  - developmental delay, poor weight gain,
  - protuberant abdomen due to hepatosplenomegaly
  - bulbar signs are prominent including:
    - convergent squint, ocular paresis, trismus, dysphagia
- the perinatal-lethal subtype is the most severe form of Gaucher
  disease
  - to death /in utero/ or hours to days after birth

** Gaucher type 3
- sub-acute or chronic neuronopathic
- type 3 disease has a later onset, with slower progression of
  neurologic manifestations and variable degrees of systemic
  involvement
- phenotype in type 3 Gaucher disease is considerably more
  heterogeneous than that in type 2
- onset of symptoms occurs later, and neurologic involvement
  progresses more slowly
- includes abnormalities in:
  - eye movements, seizures, intellectual deterioration
- the same systemic manifestations occur as in type 1 disease
  - many type 3 patients may be incorrectly classified as type 1 when
    first seen

** Biochemistry
- \beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in:
  - peripheral blood lymphocytes/leukocytes
  - dried blood spots
  - 4MU-\beta-D-glucopyranoside substrate
- \uparrow chitotriosidase activity
  - serum or plasma 
  - diagnosis and monitoring
  - CHIT1 genotype required due to common null CHIT1 allele
  - best monitoring biomarker
- \uparrow acid phosphatase
  - serum and tissue 
  - a lysosomal enzyme
- \uparrow angiotensin converting enzyme
  - plasma
  - not specific

** Molecular
- GBA gene sequencing, >300 disease alleles
- patients homozygous for the L444P mutation have severe visceral
  disease, highly predisposed to the development of CNS disease
- N370S mutant enzyme appears to preclude the development of classical CNS disease of Gaucher disease
- D409H mutation manifests a characteristic phenotype:
  - including cardiac calcification, oculomotor apraxia, and corneal opacities

* Treatment
** bone marrow transplantation
  - curative for Type 1
    - suggests hematopoietic gene therapy
  - high risk of mortality
** ERT
- treats: hematological, visceral, and bony disease
  - not cerebral disease
- macrophages have a mannose receptor
  - glucocerebrosidase glycoprotein modified to expose terminal mannose
  - Ceredase (algucerase) :: human placenta, 1991
  - Cerezyme (imiglucerase) :: CHO cells, 1994
  - VPRIV (velaglucerase) :: human fibroblasts, 2010 

** Substrate reduction therapy
- ceramide glucoyltransferase inhibitor
  - N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (miglustate)
  - eliglustat tartrate
- chaperone to stabilize - missense mutation
  - isofagomine
