#+TITLE: Sphingolipid Degradation: Gaucher
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- Caused by accumulation of glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside).
- Defect in \beta-glucocerebrosidase
  - Extremely rare SAP-C deficiency
- Most common LSD
  - 1:40,000 to 1:50,000 live births
- Three types:
  - Type 1 :: No neurological symptoms
  - Type 2 :: Acute neuronopathic
  - Type 3 :: Sub-acute or chronic neuronopathic
- Type 1 disease is common in Western Europe, the Americas and Israel
- In many other countries neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease predominate
- Glucocerebroside: the Gaucher lipid

- Located in the lumen of lysosomes
- LIMP-2 is responsible for mannose 6-phosphate receptor independent
  lysosomal targeting of \beta-glucocerebrosidase

* Genetics
- Autosomal recessive, GBA gene 
- Most of the >300 disease alleles in Gaucher disease are missense
  mutations
  - result in \beta-glucocerebrosidase with decreased catalytic
    function and/or stability.
- A variety of complex mutations/rearrangements also causes Gaucher
  disease:
  - missense mutations, frame shift mutations, splicing mutations,
    deletions, gene fusions with the pseudogene, examples of gene
    conversions, and total deletions.
- genotype/phenotype correlations exist for:
  - type 1 disease (N370S)
  - types 2 and 3 (L444P)
- within these categories there is variable penetrance and
  expressivity between individuals and ethnic groups.

= * Parkinson Disease, ** Myoclonic Seizures =

** Gaucher type 1
- Clinical manifestations of Gaucher type 1 are linked to macrophages
  engorged with glucosylceramide.

- An undefined mechanism results in:
  - enlargement and dysfunction of the liver and spleen
  - displacement of normal bone marrow by storage cells
  - osteoclastic-osteoblastic imbalances
    - subsequent damage leading to bone infarctions and fractures.
  - Occasionally, involvement of other organs (e.g. lung) contributes
    to the overall clinical picture.
  - Hypermetabolism and cachexia can be present
  - Thrombocytopenia is the most common peripheral blood abnormality 

- Neurological manifestations include:
  - a high incidence of Parkinsonism
  - spinal cord compression
  - nerve root compression
  - polyneuropathy.

** Gaucher type 2
- Type 2 is the rarer of the two classic neuronopathic variants1
- early infantile onset of acute neuronopathic disease
- progressing rapidly to death before age 2 years

  - retroflexion of the neck
  - developmental delay, poor weight gain,
  - protuberant abdomen due to hepatosplenomegaly
  - Bulbar signs are prominent including:
    - convergent squint,
    - ocular paresis,
    - trismus,
    - dysphagia

- The perinatal-lethal subtype is the most severe form of Gaucher
  disease.

  - leads to death in utero or within hours to days after
    birth

** Gaucher type 3
- type 3 disease has a later onset, with slower progression of
  neurologic manifestations and variable degrees of systemic
  involvement.
- phenotype in type 3 Gaucher disease is considerably more
  heterogeneous than that in type 2.

- onset of symptoms occurs later, and neurologic involvement
  progresses more slowly

- includes abnormalities in:
  - eye movements
  - seizures
  - intellectual deterioration.

- The same systemic manifestations occur as in type 1 disease.
  - many type 3 patients may be incorrectly classified as type 1 when
    first seen

*** Gaucher type 3a
- progressive myoclonus and dementia

*** Gaucher type 3b
- horizontal supranuclear gaze palsy without other major
  neurologic signs
- aggressive systemic disease

*** Gaucher type 3c
- present in late childhood or later
- only mild visceral signs of classic Gaucher disease
- distinguishing clinical signs include:
  - impaired horizontal ocular saccades
  - corneal opacities
  - cardiac/aortic valvular calcification

** Biochemistry
*** Enzyme Assay
- assay of the \beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in any nucleated cell
  - the enzyme does not normally occur in plasma/serum or erythrocytes
- Glucocerebrosidase activity in:
  - peripheral blood lymphocytes/leukocytes
  - dried blood spots
- 4MU-\beta-D--glucopyranoside substrate

*** Monitoring
- chitotriosidase, chemokine CLL18/PARK, glucosylsphingosine

** Molecular
- GBA gene sequencing, >300 disease alleles
- Patients homozygous for the L444P mutation have severe visceral
  disease, highly predisposed to the development of CNS disease.
- The N370S mutant enzyme appears to preclude the development of classical CNS disease of Gaucher disease.
- The D409H mutation manifests a characteristic phenotype:
  - including cardiac calcification, oculomotor apraxia, and corneal opacities.

* Treatment
** Bone marrow transplantation
  - Curative for Type 1
    - Suggests hematopoietic gene therapy
  - High risk of mortality
** ERT
- treats: hematological, visceral, and bony disease
  - not cerebral disease
- macrophages have a mannose receptor
  - glucocerebrosidase glycoprotein modified to expose terminal mannose
- 1991, Ceredase (algucerase) - human placenta
- 1994, Cerezyme (imiglucerase) - CHO cells
- 2010, VPRIV (velaglucerase) - human fibroblasts

** Substrate reduction therapy
- ceramide glucoyltransferase inhibitor
  - N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (miglustate)
  - eliglustat tartrate
- Chaperone to stabilize - missense mutation
  - isofagomine
