** OxPhos Deficiency and Anaerobic Glycolysis 
- Insufficient ATP severely affects highly energy dependant tissues
  - A complete loss of OxPhos is not observed in human disease.
- In the absence of OxPhos cells survive using ATP from anaerobic glycolysis
  - 20x less efficient, generates lactate
  - pyruvate \to alanine if glutamate is available:
  \ce{alanine + \alpha-ketoglutarate <=>[ALT] pyruvate + glutamate}
- Lactate, pyruvate and alanine are the typical products of anaerobic glycolysis

** Factors Affecting OxPhos System
- ~ 90 subunits
  - 13 subunits of Complexes I, III, IV and V encoded by mtDNA
- mitochondrial replication, transcription and translation
  - require \gt 200 proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs
- Cofactors: coenzyme Q_{10}, iron-sulfur clusters, heme, copper
  - require synthesis and/or transport to OxPhos system
- Cardiolipin required for cristae formation
- Mitochondrial function
  - protein import, turnover
  - fission, fusion
- Toxic metabolites
- \gt 1500 proteins in the human mitochondrial proteome
  - other additional factors - lipids, cofactors
  - up to 10% of human proteome may have role in maintaining mitochondrial function

- genetic defects with impaired OxPhos phenotype 
  - OxPhos Subunit
  - Assembly Factor
  - mtDNA replication
  - mtDNA transcription
  - cofactor
  - mitochondrial homeostasis
    - fission and fusion
* OxPhos Clinical Manifestations
- Clinical diagnosis is extremely challenging
  - can affect any organ system
  - antenatal (IUGR, birth defects) \to elderly (myopathy)

- Clinical Suspicion based on:
  1. Constellation of symptoms/signs consistent with a mitochondrial syndrome
  2. Complex multi-system presentation involving two/more organ systems,
     best described by an underlying disorder of energy generation.
  3. Lactic acidosis, characteristic neuro-imaging, 3-methylglutaconic
     aciduria, ragged red fiber mypopathy.
  4. Pathogenic mutation in a known mitochondrial disease gene.


- Mitochondrial disease commonly presents with:
  1) Myopathy
  2) Encephalopathy
  3) Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy
  4) Pearson Syndrome
  5) Diabetes

** Imaging
- Cranial CT shows cerebral and cerebellar atrophy in many encephalopathic patients
  - basal ganglia calcification may be seen in MELAS.
- MRI in MELAS-associated stroke reveals increased T2 weighted signals in the grey and white matter
- Symmetrical changes in the basal ganglia and brainstem observed in Leigh syndrome.

** Histology
- Muscle biopsy is diagnostic
  - mitochondrial myopathy due to mtDNA mutations and LHON may have normal biopsies.
- Ragged red fibres on Gomori trichrome staining, due to mitochondrial proliferation
- fibres stain strongly for succinate dehydrogenase
- fibres often negative for COX (complex IV) in CPEO, KSS, or MERRF but positive in MELAS.
- Leigh syndrome patients may have no ragged red fibres and  COX-negative fibres only

** Molecular
  - no strict relation between phenotype and genotype.
  - mtDNA tRNA mutations are most common of the single base change abnormalities.
    - A3243G in the tRNA^{Leu(UUR)} gene is most frequently found in MELAS
    - G8344A in tRNA^{Lys} in MERRF.
    - Many other tRNA mutations have been associated with other clinical phenotypes.
  - The primary mutations associated with LHON (G11778A, G3460A,T14484C) are in complex I genes ND4, ND1, and ND6.
    - G11778A is most common, found in over 50% of LHON families in the UK.
