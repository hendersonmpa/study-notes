#+TITLE: Disorders of Pyruvate Metabolism
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- pyruvate is formed from glucose and other monosaccharides, from
  lactate, and from the gluconeogenic amino acid alanine
- after entering the mitochondrion, pyruvate can be converted into
  acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, followed by
  further oxidation in the TCA cycle
- pyruvate can also enter the gluconeogenic pathway by sequential
  conversion into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase, followed by
  conversion to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase
- acetyl-CoA can also be formed by fatty acid oxidation or used for
  lipogenesis

** Disorders of Pyruvate Metabolism
- Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency
- Phospoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Deficiency
- Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
  - Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase Deficiency (PDHC E3)
- Pyruvate Transporter Defect

** Reactions Involving Pyruvate

 - pyruvate dehydrogenase complex :: decarboxylation \to acetyl-CoA
      
 \ce{pyruvate + CoA + NAD+ <=>[PDHC] acetyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH + H+}

 - pyruvate carboxylase :: carboxylation \to oxaloacetate

\ce{pyruvate + ATP + CO2 <=>[PC] oxaloacetate + ADP +Pi}

 - alanine transaminase :: transamination \to alanine

\ce{pyruvate + glutamate <=>[ALT] alanine + \alpha-ketoglutarate}

 - lactate dehydrogenase :: reduction \to lactate

\ce{pyruvate + NADH <=>[LDH] lactate + NAD+}

* Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency
- PC is a biotinylated mitochondrial matrix enzyme
  - carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate

  \ce{pyruvate + ATP + CO2 ->[PC] oxaloacetate + ADP +Pi}

- important role in:
  - gluconeogenesis
    - urea cycle indirectly
  - anaplerosis
    - \downarrow 2-ketoglutarate \to \downarrow glutamate
    - \downarrow TCA intermediates lowers reducing equivalents
    - redox equilibrium between 3-OH-butyrate and acetoacetate \to acetoacetate
    - \downarrow 3-OH-butyrate/acetoacetate ratio
  - lipogenesis
    - oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA \to citrate

** Biotin and Bicarbonate
- PC requires biotin and bicarbonate 
- metabolic derangements associated with PC are observed in:
  - biotin deficiency and biotinidase deficiency
  - the three biotin-dependent carboxylases:
    - Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC)
    - 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (3MCC)
    - Pyruvate carboxylase (PC)

  - CA-VA deficiency
    - results in dysfunction of all four enzymes to which CA-VA
      provides bicarbonate as substrate in mitochondria (see Urea Cycle)

** Clinical Presentation
- french phenotype (type B), most severe
  - acute illness 3-48h after birth
  - hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, vomiting
  - severe neurological dysfunction
  - death prior to 5 months
- north American phenotype (type A)
  - severe illness between 2 and 5 months of age
  - progressive hypotonia
  - acute vomiting, dehydration, tachypnoea, metabolic acidosis
  - severe intellectual disability
  - progressive with death in infancy
- benign phenotype (type c)
  - rare
  - acute episodes of lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis
  - near normal cognitive and motor development
** Genetics
- AR, PC, 1:250000
- PC is a homo-tetramer 
- PC protein and mRNA absent in 50% of french phenotype
- american and benign phenotypes have cross-reacting material
- mosaicism has been observed with prolonged survival

** Diagnostic Tests
- PC deficiency should be considered in any child presenting with
  lactic acidosis and neurological abnormalities
  - with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, or ketosis
- \uparrow L/P with \downarrow BHB/acetoacetate in severely affected patients
  - pathognomonic in neonates

- post-prandial ketosis, hypercitrullinemia, hyperammonemia, low glutamine

- CSF lactate, alanine and L/P are elevated, glutamine decreased

- PC activity in cultured skin fibroblasts
  - can not distinguish severity

** Treatment 

- Currently, no treatment

* Phospoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Deficiency
- PEPCK has cytosolic and mitochondria isoforms
- cytosolic PEPCK deficiency is secondary to hyperinsulinism
  - insulin represses expression of the cytosolic form
- mitochondrial PEPCK deficiency has not been clearly demonstrated

* Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
- PDHC decarboxylates pyruvate \to acetyl-CoA
  - thiamine dependent
- PDHC, KDHC and BCKD have similar structure and mechanism
- composed of:
  - E1 \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase
  - E2 dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase
  - E3 dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases
- E1 is specific to each complex
  - composed of E1\alpha and E1\beta
- E1 is the rate limiting step in PDHC
  - regulated by phosphorylation

- PDHC deficiency provokes conversion of pyruvate to lactate and alanine rather than acetly-CoA
- metabolism of glucose \to lactate, produces 1/10 ATP compared to
  complete oxidation via TCA and ETC
- impairs production of NADH but not oxidation 
- NADH/\ce{NAD+} is normal \therefore normal L/P
  - ETC deficiencies \to \uparrow L/P

** Clinical Presentation: PDHE1\alpha
- majority of cases involve the X encoded \alpha-subunit of the dehydrogenase (E1)
  - PDHE1\alpha deficiency
  - developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures and ataxia

- common presentations in hemizygous males:
  1. neonatal lactic acidosis
     - most severe
  2. Leigh's encephalopathy
     - most common
     - present in first 5 years
  3. intermittent ataxia
     - rare
     - ataxia after carbohydrate rich meals \to Leigh's syndrome 

- females with PDHE1\alpha, uniform presentation, variable severity
  - dismorphic features
  - moderate to severe intellectual disability
  - seizures common
  - severe neonatal lactic acidosis can be present

** Clinical Presentation: PDHE1\beta
- very rare
- similar to PDHE1\alpha

** Genetics
- all components of PDHC are encoded by nuclear genes
- autosomal except E1\alpha on Xp22.11
  - \therefore most PDHC deficiency is X-linked
- no null E1\alpha identified except in a mosaic state
  - suggests E1\alpha is essential

** Diagnostic Tests
- lactate and pyruvate in blood and CSF
- CSF lactate is generally \uparrow compared to blood
- urine organic acids
  - lactic and pyruvate
- plasma amino acids
  - alanine
- L/P ratio is usually normal
- skin fibroblasts for PDHC
  - also lymphocytes, separated from EDTA <2days
- PDHE1\alpha genotype in females is useful

** Treatment
- early adoption of ketogenic diet may have a benefit
- thiamine responsive forms
- DCA is a pyruvate analog, inhibits E1 kinase, keeps E1 dephosphorylated (active) (Figure [[fig:pdhe1]])

** Pyruvate Transport Defect
- MPC1 mutations have been described in 5 patients
- mediates the proton symport of pyruvate across the IMM
- \therefore metabolic derangement similar to PDHC deficiency
- no treatment

* Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- DLD (E3) is a flavoprotein common to all three mitochondrial
  \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes
  - PDHC, KDHC, and BCKD
- combined PDHC, TCA , BCAA defect
  - \uparrow lactate , pyruvate, 
  - alanine, glutamate, glutamine, BCAA
  - urinary lactic, pyruvic, 2-ketoglutaric, BC 2-hydroxy & 2-ketoacids

** Genetics and Diagnostic Testing
- DLD mutations AR
- 13 unrelated patients revealed 14 unique mutations
- blood lactate, pyruvate
- plasma amino acids
- urinary organic acids
- pattern of abnormalities not seen in all patients at all times
