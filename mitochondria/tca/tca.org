- Part of aerobic respiration - where is the \ce{O2}?
  - ETC regenerates \ce{NAD+} from NADH
- Cofactors:
  - niacin (\ce{NAD+})
  - riboflavin (FAD and FMN)
  - panthothenic acid (CoA)
  - thiamine
  - \ce{Mg^2+}, \ce{Ca^2+}, \ce{Fe+} and phosphate

- release of energy via oxidation of acetly-CoA
- one molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate
- Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main
  input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle
- Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic
  reaction, which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; also, the
  oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis

The functioning of the first mini-cycle (A) would allow to convert
pyruvate up to \alpha-KG, even when the second mini-cycle (B) does not
function. This could account for the urinary excretion of \alpha-KG in
patients presenting with defect of \alpha-KG, SDH or fumarase
activity. Similarly, it could produce reduced equivalents to sustain
the normal oxygen uptake measured in circulating lymphocytes or
cultured skin fibroblast from these patients.

** \alpha-ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex
- KDHC is a \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase analogous to PDHC and BCKD.

\ce{\alpha-ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA ->[KDHC] Succinyl CoA + CO2 + NADH}


| Unit | Name                               | Gene | Cofactor                    |
|------+------------------------------------+------+-----------------------------|
| E1   | \alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase | OGDH | thiamine pyrophosphate(TPP) |
| E2   | dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase  | DLST | lipoic acid, Coenzyme A     |
| E3   | dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase        | DLD  | FAD, NAD                    |

- E1 subunit is the thiamine dependant substrate specific dehydrogenase
  - Not regulated by phosphorylation.
- E2 subunit dihydrolipyoyl succinyl-transferase is also specific to KDHC

** Clinical Presentation
- Similar to PDHC
- Developmental delay, hypotonia, opisthotonos and ataxia
  - seizures less common
- Present as neonate and early childhood

** Genetics
- AR inheritence, encoded by nuclear DNA
- E1 gene mapped to 7p13
- E2 gene mapped to 14q24.3
- Molecular basis of KDHC deficiencies is not resolved.

- \alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency is sometimes a feature of DLD deficiency

** Diagnostic Tests
- Urine organic acids
  - \uparrow \alpha-KGA, \pm other TCA intermediates
  - \alpha-KGA is a common finding, not specific for KDHC deficiency
- Blood lactate
  - Normal or increased L/P
- KDHC activity
  - \ce{^14CO2} release from \ce{[1-^14C]} \alpha-ketoglutarate (or \ce{[1-^14C]} leucine)
  - cultured skin fibroblasts
  - muscle

** Treatment
- None to date

* Succinate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

** Succinate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

** Succinate Dehydrogenase | Complex II
- Four subunits compose Complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain

| Subunit name | Protein description                                |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| SdhA         | Succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit       |
| SdhB         | Succinate dehydrogenase iron-sulfur subunit        |
| SdhC         | Succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b560 subunit    |
| SdhD         | Succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b small subunit |

- The SdhA subunit contains an FAD binding site where succinate
  is deprotonated and converted to fumarate.

succinate + ubiquinone \to fumarate + ubiquinol

- Electrons removed from succinate transfer to SdhA
- transfer across SdhB through iron sulphur clusters to the SdhC/SdhD subunits
  - SdhC/SdhD are anchored in the mitochondrial membrane.

** Clinical Presentation
- Very rare disorder with highly variable phenotype
- Complex II is part of the TCA cycle and ETC
  - phenotype resembles defects in respiratory chain
- Clinical picture can include:
  - Kearns-Sayre syndrome
  - isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  - combined cardiac and skeletal myopathy
  - generalized muscle weakness, \uparrow fatiguability
  - early onset Leigh encephalopathy
- Also:
  - cerebral ataxia
  - optic atropy
  - tumour formation in adults

** Genetics

- All components of Complex II are encoded by nuclear DNA.

| Gene | Location |
|------+----------|
| SDHA | 5p15.33  |
| SDHB | 1p36.13  |
| SDHC | 1q23.3   |
| SDHD | 11q23.1  |


- AR with highly variable phenotype
- Case of affected sisters with one identified SDHA mutation suggested
  dominant transmission
- Mutations in SDHB, SDHC and SDHD cause susceptibility to familial
  phaeochromocytoma and familial paraganglioma.

** Diagnostic Tests
- Unlike other TCA cycle disorders Complex II deficiency does not always
  result in characteristic organic aciduria
  - succinic aciduria.
- Organic acids can show variable amounts of lactate, pyruvate, succinate, fumarate and malate

- Measurement of complex II activity in muscle is the most reliable
  means of diagnosis
  - there is no clear correlation between residual complex II activity
    and severity or clinical outcome.

** Treatment 

- In some cases, treatment with riboflavin may have clinical benefit

* Fumarase Deficiency
** Fumarase Deficiency

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[file:./tca/figures/fumarase.png]]

** Fumarase 
- Fumarase catalyses reversible hydration/dehydration of fumarate to malate
- Two forms: mitochondrial and cytosolic.
  - The mitochondrial isoenzyme is involved in the TCA Cycle
  - The cytosolic isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of amino acids and fumarate.
- Subcellular localization is established by the presence/absence of an N-terminal mitochondrial signal
  sequence
- Deficiency causes impaired energy production

** Clinical Presentation
- Characterized by polyhydramnios and fetal brain abnormalities.
- In the newborn period, findings include:
  - severe neurologic abnormalities,
  - poor feeding,
  - failure to thrive
  - hypotonia.

- Fumarase deficiency is suspected in infants with multiple severe
  neurologic abnormalities in the absence of an acute metabolic
  crisis.

- Inactivity of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of
  fumarase are potential causes.

** Genetics

- AR inheritance, encoded by nuclear DNA
- Single gene and mRNA encode mito and cyto isoforms

** Diagnostic Tests

- Isolated, increased concentration of fumaric acid on urine organic
  acid analysis is highly suggestive of fumarase deficiency.
  - Succinate, \alpha-KGA can also be elevated
- Molecular genetic testing for fumarase deficiency is currently available

* Isocitrate Dehydrogenase
** Isocitrate Dehydrogenase
- IDH exists in three isoforms:
  - IDH3 catalyzes the third step of the citric acid cycle while converting \ce{NAD+} to NADH in the mitochondria.

\ce{isocitrate + NAD+ ->[IHD3] \alpha-ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH + H+}

  - IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the same reaction outside TCA cycle and use \ce{NADP+} as a cofactor.
    - They localize to the cytosol as well as the mitochondrion and peroxisome.

\ce{isocitrate + NADP+ ->[IHD1/2] \alpha-ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADPH + H+}

** Clinical relevance

- IDH3 deficiency is associated with retinitis pigmentosa
- IDH1/2 mutations linked to malignant gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia

- Mutations in IDH2 identified in half of patients
