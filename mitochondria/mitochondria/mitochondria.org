* Background
** Mitochondria
- A double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms
  - liver cells can have more than 2000
  - red blood cells have no mitochondria

- The organelle is composed of an outer membrane, intermembrane
  space, and inner membrane with cristae and matrix.

- The mitochondrion has its own independent genome that shows
  substantial similarity to bacterial genomes

- Mitochondrial proteins transcribed from mtDNA vary depending on the
  tissue and the species.

- In humans, 615 distinct types of protein have been identified from
  cardiac mitochondria.

** Maternal Inheritance
- Mitochondria and therefore the mtDNA, usually come from the egg
  - the egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria
  - these mitochondria divide to populate the cells
- Sperm mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic
  information to the embryo.
  - paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin for destruction
    inside the embryo.

- paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin for destruction
  inside the embryo.
- mitochondria are randomly distributed to the daughter cells during
  the division of the cytoplasm.

** Heteroplasmy

- Heteroplasmy is the presence of more than one type of organellar
  genome within a cell or individual.

- It is an important factor in considering the severity of
  mitochondrial diseases.
  - can also be beneficial

- Microheteroplasmy is present in most individuals.
  - hundreds of independent mutations, with each mutation found in
    about 1–2% of all mitochondrial genomes.


- Although detrimental scenarios are well-studied, heteroplasmy can
  also be beneficial. For example, centenarians show a higher than
  average degree of heteroplasmy.

- Microheteroplasmy is present in most individuals. This refers to
  hundreds of independent mutations in one organism, with each
  mutation found in about 1-2% of all mitochondrial genomes.

** Muller's Ratchet and the Mitochondrial Bottleneck

- Entities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no
  recombination can be subject to "Muller's ratchet"
  - the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until
    functionality is lost.

- Applies to entities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no
  recombination
  - the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality
    is lost.

- mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process
  known as the mtDNA bottleneck. 
  - selection acts to remove those cells with more deleterious mtDNA

** Fusion
- response to cellular stress
- enables genetic complementation
  - fusion of the mitochondria allows two mitochondrial genomes with
    different defects within the same organelle to encode what the
    other lacks.
  - mtDNA damage
- enables genetic complementation

** Replication and Fission

- Mitochondria divide by binary fission, similar to bacterial cell division

- mammalian mitochondria replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response
  to the energy needs of the cell, not in phase with the cell cycle.
  - When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and
    divide.
  - When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed
    or become inactive.

** Human Mitochondrial DNA
- a circular DNA molecule ~ 16 kb
- encodes 37 genes
  - 13 for subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV and V
  - 22 for mitochondrial tRNA
    - 20 standard amino acids, plus extra gene for leu and ser
  - 2 for rRNA.
- One mitochondrion can contain two to ten copies of its DNA.

** Alternative genetic code

- The mitochondria of many eukaryotes, including most plants, use the
  standard code.

#+CAPTION[mito code]: Exceptions to the standard genetic code in mamalian mitochondria
#+NAME: tab:code 
| Codon    | Standard   | Mitochondria |
|----------+------------+--------------|
| AGA, AGG | Arginine   | Stop codon   |
| AUA      | Isoleucine | Methionine   |
| UGA      | Stop codon | Tryptophan   |

- AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.
- Some of these differences are pseudo-changes in the genetic code due
  to the phenomenon of RNA editing, common in mitochondria.

** Mitochondrial Disease
- About 15% of mitochondrial disease is caused by mutations in the
  mitochondrial DNA that affect mitochondrial function.
- Other mitochondrial diseases are caused by
  - mutations  in nuclear DNA
  - acquired mitochondrial conditions (drugs, toxins)

* Biochemical Functions Relevant to IMD   
** Pyruvate and the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle
#+CAPTION[tca]:TCA
#+NAME: fig:tca

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.8\textwidth
[[file:./mitochondria/figures/tca.png]]

- oxidation of pyruvate \rightarrow 3 NADH, 1 \ce{FADH2}, and 1 GTP


- release of energy via oxidation of acetly-CoA
- one molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate
- Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main
  input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle
- Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic
  reaction, which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; also, the
  oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis

** Electron Transport Chain
- Energy obtained through the transfer of electrons down the ETC is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space
  - creates an electrochemical proton gradient (\Delta{}pH) across the IMM.
    - largely responsible for the mitochondrial membrane potential (\Delta\Psi{}M).
  - ATP synthase uses flow of \ce{H+} through the enzyme back into the
    matrix to generate ATP from ADP and Pi.

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./mitochondria/figures/etc.pdf]]

- Complex I (NADH coenzyme Q reductase) accepts electrons from the Krebs cycle electron carrier NADH
- passes them to CoQ (ubiquinone; labeled Q),
- CoQ also receives electrons from complex II (succinate dehydrogenase).
- CoQ passes electrons to complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex; labeled III), which passes them to cytochrome c (cyt c).
- Cyt c passes electrons to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase; labeled IV), which uses the electrons and hydrogen ions to reduce molecular oxygen to water. 

** ATP synthase
- formation of ATP from ADP and Pi is energetically unfavorable
- ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis to an electrochemical gradient (\Delta\Psi{}M).

Simplified picture of ATP syntase The Fo part through which hydrogen
ions (H+) stream is located in the membrane. The F1 part which
synthesises ATP is outside the membrane. When the hydrogen ions flow
through the membrane via the disc of c subunits in the Fo part, the
disc is forced to twist around. The gamma subunit in the F1 part is
attached to the disc and therefore rotates with it. The three alpha
and three beta subunits in the F1 part cannot rotate, however. They
are locked in a fixed position by the b subunit. This in turn is
anchored in the membrane. Thus the gamma subunit rotates inside the
cylinder formed by the six alpha and beta subunits. Since the gamma
subunit is asymmetrical it compels the beta subunits to undergo
structural changes. This leads to the beta subunits binding ATP and
ADP with differing strengths (see Figure 2).


Figure 2. Boyer’s “Binding Change Mechanism” The picture shows the
cylinder with alternating alpha and beta subunits at four different
stages of ATP synthesis. The asymmetrical gamma subunit that causes
changes in the structure of the beta subunits can be seen in the
centre. The structures are termed open betaO (light grey sector),
loose betaL (grey sector) and tight betaT (black sector). At stage A
we see an already-fully-formed ATP molecule bound to betaT. In the
step to stage B betaL binds ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi ). At the
next stage, C, we see how the gamma subunit has twisted due to the
flow of hydrogen ions (see Figure 1). This brings about changes in the
structure of the three beta subunits. The tight beta subunit now
becomes open and the bound ATP molecule is released. The loose beta
subunit becomes tight and the open becomes loose. In the last stage
the chemical reaction takes place in which phosphate ions react with
the ADP molecule to form a new ATP molecule. We are back at the first
stage.

- ketone bodies are a way to move energy from the liver to other cells.
- The liver does not have the succinyl-CoA transferase, to metabolize ketone bodies
- liver produces ketone bodies, but does not use a significant amount of them.
