* Background
** Maternal Inheritance
- mitochondria and therefore the mtDNA, usually come from the egg
  - the egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria
  - these mitochondria divide to populate the cells
- sperm mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic
  information to the embryo
  - paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin for destruction
    inside the embryo
- mitochondria are randomly distributed to the daughter cells during
  the division of the cytoplasm

** Heteroplasmy
- heteroplasmy is the presence of more than one type of organellar
  genome within a cell or individual
- it is an important factor in considering the severity of
  mitochondrial diseases
  - can also be beneficial
- microheteroplasmy is present in most individuals
  - hundreds of independent mutations, with each mutation found in
    about 1-2% of all mitochondrial genomes

** Muller's Ratchet and the Mitochondrial Bottleneck
- entities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no
  recombination can be subject to "Muller's ratchet"
  - the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until
    functionality is lost

- mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process
  known as the mtDNA bottleneck
  - selection acts to remove those cells with more deleterious mtDNA

** Fusion
- response to cellular stress
- enables genetic complementation
  - fusion of the mitochondria allows two mitochondrial genomes with
    different defects within the same organelle to encode what the
    other lacks
  - corrects for mtDNA damage
  
** Replication and Fission
- mitochondria divide by binary fission, similar to bacterial cell division
- mammalian mitochondria replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response
  to the energy needs of the cell, not in phase with the cell cycle
  - when the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and
    divide
  - when the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed
    or become inactive
** Human Mitochondrial DNA
- a circular DNA molecule ~ 16 kb
- encodes 37 genes
  - 13 for subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV and V
  - 22 for mitochondrial tRNA
    - 20 standard amino acids, plus extra genes for leu and ser
  - 2 for rRNA
- one mitochondrion can contain two to ten copies of its DNA

** Alternative genetic code
- the mitochondria of many eukaryotes, including most plants, use the
  standard code

#+NAME: tab:code 
| Codon    | Standard   | Mitochondria |
|----------+------------+--------------|
| AGA, AGG | Arginine   | Stop codon   |
| AUA      | Isoleucine | Methionine   |
| UGA      | Stop codon | Tryptophan   |

- AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons
- some of these differences are pseudo-changes in the genetic code due
  to the phenomenon of RNA editing, common in mitochondria

** Mitochondrial Disease
- about 15% of mitochondrial disease is caused by mutations in the
  mitochondrial DNA that affect mitochondrial function
- other mitochondrial diseases are caused by
  - mutations in nuclear DNA
  - acquired mitochondrial conditions (drugs, toxins)
