* Introduction
- fatty acids are usually straight aliphatic chains with a methyl
  group at one end (\omega-carbon) and a carboxyl group at the other
  end

  - Stearic acid :: C18:0 from the Greek word "stear", which means tallow
  - Oleic acid :: C18:1 oleic means related to, or derived from, olive oil  
- position of a double bond is designated by the number of the carbon in the double bond that is closest to the carboxyl group

  - very long-chain :: > C20
  - long-chain :: C12-C20
  - medium-chain :: C6-C12
  - short-chain :: C4
** Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation

- involves three processes (Figure [[fig:box]])
  1) entry of fatty acids into mitochondria
     - long-chain fatty acids are activated to coenzyme A (CoA) esters
       in the cytoplasm
     - need to be transferred to carnitine to cross the inner
       mitochondrial membrane
     - they are transferred back to CoA within the mitochondria
     - CPT I is the main site for the regulation of fatty acid
       oxidation by cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA
     - medium and short-chain fatty acids enter mitochondria
       independent of carnitine and are activated to CoA esters in the
       matrix
  2) \beta-oxidation via a spiral pathway
     - each turn of the spiral shortens the acyl-CoA by two carbons and involves four steps:
       - two dehydrogenation reactions linked respectively to FAD and NAD
     - \beta-oxidation is catalysed by enzymes of different chain
       length specificity
     - enzymes for long-chain substrates are membrane-bound
       - three of the reactions are catalysed by the mitochondrial
         trifunctional protein (MTP)
       - medium and short-chain enzymes are located in the matrix
  3) electron transfer
     - electrons are passed to the respiratory chain either directly
       (from NADH to complex I) or via two transfer proteins (from
       FADH_2 to ubiquinone)

** Common manifestations in FAODs
 - fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
   - primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
   - hepatic glucose output is also reduced under some conditions
 - the hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic
   - ketone bodies can be synthesised
     - medium-or short-chain FAODs or if there is high residual enzyme activity
     - plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or the plasma free fatty acid concentrations
 - hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects
   - with normal or low glutamine concentrations
   - decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate
 - lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
   - inhibitory effects of metabolites on pyruvate metabolism
 - moderate hyperuricaemia - frequent finding during acute attacks
 - secondary hyperprolinaemia occurs in some babies with MAD deficiency
 - accumulating long-chain acylcarnitines may be responsible for
   arrhythmias and may interfere with surfactant metabolism
 - in LCHAD and MTP deficiencies, long chain hydroxy-acylcarnitine
   concentrations correlate with the severity of retinopathy and may
   cause both this and the peripheral neuropathy

* Carnitine Cycle Defects
- carnitine-mediated transport of fatty acids is rate-limiting in the
  oxidation of fats
- a defect anywhere in the pathway would be expected to lead to
  inadequate formation of ketone bodies in response to fasting along
  with inadequate gluconeogenesis and hypoglycemia.
** Carnitine Transporter Deficiency
- AKA: primary carnitine deficiency, carnitine uptake deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, muscle weakness, liver disease
- precipitated by infection, fasting, pregnancy or antibiotics containing pivalate
  - pivalate is excreted bound to carnitine \to \downarrow carnitine concentration
    - isobaric with C5-carnitine
- some present in infancy with hypoglycaemia, liver dysfunction and hyperammonaemia
- other children develop heart failure due to cardiomyopathy,
  thickened ventricular walls and reduced contractility
- often accompanied by skeletal muscle weakness
- adults may suffer fatigue or arrhythmias
- screening has shown that many subjects with low plasma carnitine remain asymptomatic
*** Metabolic Derangement
- organic cation/carnitine transporter(OCTN2) responsible for
  carnitine uptake (Figure [[fig:trans]])
  - analysis of carnitine transport in different tissues suggests the
    presence of heterogeneous transporters
  - liver and brain have a low-affinity (K_M=2-10 uM), high-capacity transporter
  - fibroblast, muscle, and heart cells have a high-affinity (K_M=5-10 uM), low-capacity system
- defects \to primary carnitine deficiency with \uparrow renal loss of carnitine
  - \downarrow plasma concentrations
  - \downarrow intracellular concentrations \to impair fatty acid
    oxidation

#+CAPTION[]:Carnitine Transporter
#+NAME: fig:trans

[[file:./fao/figures/transporter.png]]

*** Genetics
- AR, OCTN2
*** Diagnostic Testing
- \Downarrow plasma total carnitine, \lt 5% of normal
- \uparrow urine free carnitine
*** Treatment 
- carnitine supplementation
** Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- usually present by the age of 2 years with hypoketotic hypoglycaemia
  - induced by fasting or illness
- accompanied by hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction and occasionally cholestasis
  - may also be transient lipaemia and renal tubular acidosis
*** Metabolic Derangement
- CPT1 is responsible for the formation of acyl carnitines
  - catalyzes transfer of the acyl group of a long-chain fatty
    acyl-CoA from coenzyme A to l-carnitine
  - allows for subsequent movement of the acyl carnitine from the
    cytosol into the intermembrane space of mitochondria
- *CPTIa* liver and kidney
- *CPTIb*  muscle and heart
- *CPTIc*  brain
- only CPTIa deficiency has been identified
- medium chain and short chain fatty acids pass directly into
  mitochondria and do not require esterification with carnitine
- CPT II is situated on the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes
  the regeneration of carnitine and the long chain fatty acyl CoAs,
  which then undergo \beta-oxidation

#+CAPTION[]:CPT1
#+NAME: fig:cpt1
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.6\textwidth
[[file:./fao/figures/cpt1.png]]

*** Genetics
- AR, CPT1A
- CPTI deficiency is extremely common in the Inuit population of Canada and Greenland
  - c.1436C>T, P479L 
- a few of these patients present with hypoglycaemia as neonates or young children
  - most remain asymptomatic
*** Diagnostic Testing
- \uparrow total/free carnitine
- \uparrow C0
- \downarrow C16, C18, C18:1
*** Treatment
- prevent hypoglycaemia
- low-fat diet
- medium-chain triglycerides to provide \sim 1/3 total calories
  - C6-C10 fatty acids do not require the carnitine shuttle for entry into the mitochondrion
** Carnitine Acylcarnitine Translocase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- rare disorder usually presents in the neonatal period, with
  death by 3 months of age
  - severe hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia, cardiomyopathy,
    atrioventricular block and ventricular arrhythmias
- few more mildly affected patients present later with hypoglycaemic
  encephalopathy
  - precipitated by fasting or infections
*** Metabolic Derangement
- carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase, catalyzes the transfer of the
  acylcarnitines across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Figure [[fig:translocase]])
- deficiency of carnitine acyl translocase leads to the accumulation
  of the free fatty acids outside the mitochondrial matrix
- long chain acylcarnitines and short chains are also found, because
  translocase catalyzes the transport of short as well as long chain
  acylcarnitines
- \Uparrow long chain acyl carnitines during illness and fasting
  induced lipolysis
- \uparrow medium and short chain esters might reflect the acyl CoA products
  of peroxisomal oxidation that would require transfer into the
  mitochondria via the translocase for final oxidation
- secondary deficiency of free carnitine would be expected to result
  from the excretion over time of large amounts of esterified
  carnitine

**** Neonatal
 - severe neonatal onset CPT II deficiency is usually lethal
 - patients become comatose within a few days of birth
   - hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia
   - may have cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias and congenital malformations,
     principally renal cysts and neuronal migration defects
 - also an intermediate form of CPT II deficiency that causes
   episodes of hypoglycaemia and liver dysfunction, sometimes
   accompanied by cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias

**** Childhood
 - episodes may be brought on by infections or exercise
 - moderate or severe episodes there is myoglobinuria, \uparrow CK
   - may lead to acute renal failure
   - CK often normalises between episodes but may remain moderately
     elevated

**** Adolescence and Adult
 - most common form is a partial deficiency that presents with
   episodes of rhabdomyolysis
   - usually precipitated by prolonged exercise
   - particularly in the cold or after fasting 

*** Metabolic Derangement 
- CPTII is situated on the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the
  regeneration of carnitine and the long chain fatty acyl CoAs, which
  then undergo \beta-oxidation (Figure [[fig:cpt1]])
*** Genetics
- AR, CPT2
*** Diagnostic Testing
- \downarrow total carnitine
- \uparrow (C16 + C18)/C2

*** Treatment
- high-carbohydrate (70%) and low-fat (<20%) diet to provide fuel for glycolysis
- carnitine to convert potentially toxic long-chain acyl-CoAs to
  acylcarnitines
* \beta-Oxidation Defects
** Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
**** Infancy 
 - severely affected patients present in early infancy with
   cardiomyopathy, in addition to the problems seen in milder patients
**** Childhood
 - patients present in childhood with hypoglycaemia but suffer exercise
   or illness induced rhabdomyolysis or chronic weakness at a later age
**** Adolescence and Adult
 - mildly affected patients present as adolescents or adults with
   exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis
*** Metabolic Derangement
- VLCAD is one of four mitochondrial acyl CoA dehydrogenases that
  catalyze the initial steps in the \beta-oxidation of fatty acids
  (Table [[tab:deh]])
- optimal substrate is c16, palmitoy-CoA
- ACAD9 is responsible for production of C14:1-carnitine and
  C12-carnitine in VLCAD deficiency

** Mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- presentation of generalised MTP deficiency is heterogeneous 
- patients with severe deficiency present as neonates
  - cardiomyopathy, respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia and liver dysfunction
  - most die within a few months, regardless of treatment
- other patients resemble those with isolated LCHAD deficiency
- milder neuromyopathic phenotype:
  - exercise induced rhabdomyolysis and progressive peripheral
    neuropathy
  - can present at any age from infancy to adulthood
- mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency have a high
  risk of illness during pregnancies when carrying an affected fetus
  - main problems are HELLP syndrome (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver
    enzymes and Low Platelets) and acute fatty liver of pregnancy
    (AFLP)
*** Metabolic Derangement
- MTP a hetero-octamer composed of four \alpha-subunits and four
  \beta-subunits
- \alpha-subunit has long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (LCEH) and LCHAD
  activities
- \beta-subunit has long-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (LCKAT) activity
- patients may have isolated LCHAD deficiency or a generalised
  deficiency of all three enzyme activities
- MTP deficiency can result from mutations that affect the assembly of
  and/or degradation of the heterooctomeric holoenzyme

*** Diagnostic Tests
- see LCHAD

*** Treatment 
- see LCHAD

** Long-Chain 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase
*** Clinical Presentation
- isolated LCHAD deficiency usually presents acutely before 6 months of age
  - hypoglycaemia, liver dysfunction, lactic acidosis
  - many have cardiomyopathy, some have hypoparathyroidism or ARDS
- other patients present with chronic symptoms
  - failure to thrive, hypotonia, occasionally cholestasis or cirrhosis
- subsequently, episodes of rhabdomyolysis are common
- many patients develop retinopathy, may start as early as 2 years of age
- granular pigmentation followed by chorioretinal atrophy w deteriorating central vision

** Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- LCAD is one of four mitochondrial acyl CoA dehydrogenases that
  catalyze the initial steps in the \beta-oxidation of fatty acids
  (Table [[tab:deh]])
- no human disease-causing mutations have been identified
- role  in  human  metabolism  is unclear
- the substrate specificity of LCAD overlaps with that of
  VLCAD and MCAD

** Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- most common FAOD with an incidence of approximately 1:10,000-20,000
  in Europe,USA and Australia
- before NBS, presented 4 months to 4 years
  - acute hypoglycaemic encephalopathy and liver dysfunction, not always
  - some deteriorated rapidly and died
- precipitated by prolonged fasting or infection with vomiting
- some babies still present within 72 hours of birth before
  newborn screening results are available
  - hypoglycaemia and/or arrhythmias
  - breast-fed babies are at higher risk, due to the small supply of
    breast milk at this stage
- MCAD deficiency only presents clinically if exposed to an
  appropriate environmental stress
  - prior to NBS ~ 30-50% remained asymptomatic
- with NBS and preventative measures, hypoglycaemia is rare
  - patients do not develop cardiomyopathy or myopathy and few present
    initially as adults
- healty MCAD deficient children > 1 year can fast for 12-14 hours without problems
  - >14 hours \to hypoketotic hypoglycaemia
- shorter fasts may cause problems in infancy
- encephalopathy may occur without hypoglycaemia
  - accumulation of FFA acids and carnitine/CoA esters
*** Metabolic Derangement
- MCAD is one of four mitochondrial acyl CoA dehydrogenases that
  catalyze the initial steps in the \beta-oxidation of fatty acids

- others develop cardiomyopathy and die within a few months
- less severe cases can present at any age from infancy to adulthood
 - with hypoglycaemia, liver dysfunction and weakness
 - usually precipitated by an infection
- cardiomyopathy is common in infants
- mildly affected children may have recurrent bouts of vomiting
- muscle weakness is the commonest presentation in adolescents and adults
 - predominantly affects proximal muscles and may lead to scoliosis,
   hypoventilation or an inability to lift the chin off the chest

*** Metabolic Derangement
- Electron Transfer Flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF Ubiquinone
  Oxidoreductase (ETFQO) carry electrons to the respiratory chain from
  multiple FAD-linked dehydrogenases
- includes enzymes of amino acid, choline metabolism and acyl-CoA
  dehydrogenases of \beta-oxidation
- GAII less often, a result of defects of riboflavin transport or
