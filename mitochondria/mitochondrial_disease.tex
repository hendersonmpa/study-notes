\section{Mitochondria}
\label{sec:org8d290f7}
\subsection{Background}
\label{sec:orgf015186}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mitochondria
\label{sec:orgc2b3f90}
\begin{itemize}
\item A double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms
\begin{itemize}
\item liver cells can have more than 2000
\item red blood cells have no mitochondria
\end{itemize}

\item The organelle is composed of an outer membrane, intermembrane
space, and inner membrane with cristae and matrix.

\item The mitochondrion has its own independent genome that shows
substantial similarity to bacterial genomes

\item Mitochondrial proteins transcribed from mtDNA vary depending on the
tissue and the species.

\item In humans, 615 distinct types of protein have been identified from
cardiac mitochondria.
\end{itemize}

\item Maternal Inheritance
\label{sec:org790cac5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mitochondria and therefore the mtDNA, usually come from the egg
\begin{itemize}
\item the egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria
\item these mitochondria divide to populate the cells
\end{itemize}
\item Sperm mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic
information to the embryo.
\begin{itemize}
\item paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin for destruction
inside the embryo.
\end{itemize}
\item mitochondria are randomly distributed to the daughter cells during
the division of the cytoplasm.
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./mitochondria/figures/Mitochondrial_Bottleneck.png}
\caption[mom]{\label{fig:org9b0e2ad}
Maternal Inheritance}
\end{figure}

\item Heteroplasmy
\label{sec:org58ef9c7}

\begin{itemize}
\item Heteroplasmy is the presence of more than one type of organellar
genome within a cell or individual.

\item It is an important factor in considering the severity of
mitochondrial diseases.
\begin{itemize}
\item can also be beneficial
\end{itemize}

\item Microheteroplasmy is present in most individuals.
\begin{itemize}
\item hundreds of independent mutations, with each mutation found in
about 1â€“2\% of all mitochondrial genomes.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Muller's Ratchet and the Mitochondrial Bottleneck
\label{sec:org04db65f}
\begin{itemize}
\item Entities undergoing uniparental inheritance and with little to no
recombination can be subject to "Muller's ratchet"
\begin{itemize}
\item the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until
functionality is lost.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./mitochondria/figures/heteroplasmy.png}
\caption[heter]{\label{fig:org1f816c4}
Heteroplasmy}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process
known as the mtDNA bottleneck. 
\begin{itemize}
\item selection acts to remove those cells with more deleterious mtDNA
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./mitochondria/figures/bottle_neck.jpg}
\caption[bottle]{\label{fig:orgf5c66a8}
Mitochondrial bottle neck}
\end{figure}

\item Fusion
\label{sec:org5d5e86d}
\begin{itemize}
\item response to cellular stress
\item enables genetic complementation
\begin{itemize}
\item fusion of the mitochondria allows two mitochondrial genomes with
different defects within the same organelle to encode what the
other lacks.
\item mtDNA damage
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Replication and Fission
\label{sec:org6ad5f24}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mitochondria divide by binary fission, similar to bacterial cell division
\item mammalian mitochondria replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response
to the energy needs of the cell, not in phase with the cell cycle.
\begin{itemize}
\item When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and
divide.
\item When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed
or become inactive.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Human Mitochondrial DNA
\label{sec:org67f9499}
\begin{itemize}
\item a circular DNA molecule \textasciitilde{} 16 kb
\item encodes 37 genes
\begin{itemize}
\item 13 for subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV and V
\item 22 for mitochondrial tRNA
\begin{itemize}
\item 20 standard amino acids, plus extra gene for leu and ser
\end{itemize}
\item 2 for rRNA.
\end{itemize}
\item One mitochondrion can contain two to ten copies of its DNA.
\end{itemize}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./mitochondria/figures/mitochondrial_genome.png}
\caption[mtdna]{\label{fig:org5914b6c}
Human mitochondrial genome}
\end{figure}

\item Alternative genetic code
\label{sec:org9535ed5}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mitochondria of many eukaryotes, including most plants, use the
standard code.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[htbp]

Codon & Standard & Mitochondria\\
\hline
AGA, AGG & Arginine & Stop codon\\
AUA & Isoleucine & Methionine\\
UGA & Stop codon & Tryptophan\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.
\item Some of these differences are pseudo-changes in the genetic code due
to the phenomenon of RNA editing, common in mitochondria.
\end{itemize}

\item Mitochondrial Disease
\label{sec:org6978c4e}
\begin{itemize}
\item About 15\% of mitochondrial disease is caused by mutations in the
mitochondrial DNA that affect mitochondrial function.
\item Other mitochondrial diseases are caused by
\begin{itemize}
\item mutations in nuclear DNA
\item acquired mitochondrial conditions (drugs, toxins)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\caption[pdhc]{\label{fig:org4053b81}
Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex}
\end{figure}

\item Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency
\label{sec:org901a832}
\begin{itemize}
\item PDHC deficiency provokes conversion of pyruvate to lactate and alanine rather than acetly-CoA
\item Metabolism of glucose \(\to\) lactate, produces 1/10 ATP compared to
complete oxidation via TCA and ETC
\item Impairs production of NADH but not oxidation
\item NADH/\ce{NAD+} is normal, \(\therefore\) normal L/P
\begin{itemize}
\item ETC deficiencies \(\to\) \(\uparrow\) L/P
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Clinical Presentation: PDHE1\(\alpha\)
\label{sec:org5567b16}

\begin{itemize}
\item Only a few cases
\item similar to PDHE1\(\alpha\)
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org2643c7d}
\begin{itemize}
\item All components of PDHC are encoded by nuclear genes
\item Autosomal except E1\(\alpha\) on Xp22.11
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) most PDHC deficiency is X-linked
\end{itemize}
\item No null E1\(\alpha\) identified except in a mosaic state
\begin{itemize}
\item suggests E1\(\alpha\) is essential
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orge198baf}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lactate and pyruvate in blood and CSF

\item Skin fibroblasts for PDHC
\begin{itemize}
\item also lymphocytes, separated from EDTA <2days
\end{itemize}
\item PDHE1\(\alpha\) genotype in females is useful
\end{itemize}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org0ea0e91}
\begin{itemize}
\item Early adoption of ketogenic diet may have a benefit
\item Thiamine responsive forms
\item DCA is a pyruvate analog, inhibits E1 kinase, keeps E1 dephosphorylated (active) (Figure \ref{fig:orgb2b5b65})
\end{itemize}

\item Pyruvate Transport Defect
\label{sec:orgf0b1744}
\begin{itemize}
\item MPC1 mutations have been described in 5 patients
\item mediates the proton symport of pyruvate across the IMM.
\item \(\therefore\) metabolic derangement similar to PDHC deficiency
\item No treatment
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
\item ATP synthase uses flow of \ce{H+} through the enzyme back into the
matrix to generate ATP from ADP and Pi.
\end{itemize}
\item There are three energy-transducing enzymes in the electron transport
chain:
\begin{itemize}
\item NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I)
\item Coenzyme Q â€“ cytochrome c reductase (complex III)
\item cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV).
\item also ETF-QO and mitochondrial GPD

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle}

subunit (ETFA and ETFB), and contain an FAD cofactor and AMP

\item ETQ-QO links the oxidation of fatty acids and some amino acids to
oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria.

\begin{itemize}
\item Discussed more in Lysine Catabolism
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Complex III}
\label{sec:org6367400}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complex III | Coenzyme Q â€“ cytochrome c reductase
\label{sec:org311677b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complex III is a multi-subunit transmembrane protein encoded by both
mitochondrial (cytochrome B) and the nuclear genomes (all other
subunits)

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\small\ce{QH2 + 2Fe^{3+}-cyt c + 2H+_{in} ->[CIII]  Q + 2Fe^{2+}-cyt c + 4H+_{out}}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Mechanism
\label{sec:orga2b2f90}
\begin{itemize}
\item Round 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cytochrome b binds a ubiquinol and a ubiquinone.
\item The 2Fe/2S center and BL heme each pull an electron off the bound ubiquinol, releasing two hydrogens into the intermembrane space.
\item One electron is transferred to cytochrome c1 from the 2Fe/2S centre, whilst another is transferred from the BL heme to the BH Heme.
\item Cytochrome c1 transfers its electron to cytochrome c (not to be confused with cytochrome c1), and the BH Heme transfers its electron to a nearby ubiquinone, resulting in the formation of a ubisemiquinone.
\item Cytochrome c diffuses. The first ubiquinol (now oxidised to ubiquinone) is released, whilst the semiquinone remains bound.
\end{itemize}

\item Round 2:
\begin{itemize}
\item A second ubiquinol is bound by cytochrome b.
\item The 2Fe/2S center and BL heme each pull an electron off the bound ubiquinol, releasing two hydrogens into the intermembrane space.
\item One electron is transferred to cytochrome c1 from the 2Fe/2S centre, whilst another is transferred from the BL heme to the BH Heme.
\item Cytocrome c1 then transfers its electron to cytochrome c, whilst the nearby semiquinone produced from round 1 picks up a second electron from the BH heme, along with two protons from the matrix.
\item The second ubiquinol (now oxidised to ubiquinone), along with the newly formed ubiquinol are released.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:org8181f3f}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are three distinct groups of Complex III inhibitors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Antimycin A binds to the Q\(_{\text{i}}\) site and inhibits the transfer of electrons in Complex III from heme b\(_{\text{H}}\) to oxidized Q (Q\(_{\text{i}}\) site inhibitor).
\item Myxothiazol and stigmatellin bind to distinct but overlapping pockets within the Q\(_{\text{o}}\) site.
\begin{itemize}
\item Myxothiazol binds nearer to cytochrome bL (hence termed a "proximal" inhibitor).
\item Stigmatellin binds farther from heme bL and nearer the Rieske Iron sulfur protein.
\item Both inhibit the transfer of electrons from reduced QH\(_{\text{2}}\) to the Rieske Iron sulfur protein.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Complex IV}
\label{sec:org14b96e8}

\begin{itemize}
\item last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain.
\item large IMM integral membrane protein composed of several metal prosthetic sites and 14 protein subunits.
\item eleven subunits are nuclear in origin, and three are synthesized in the mitochondria. 
\begin{itemize}
\item contains two hemes,
\item cytochrome a and cytochrome a3,
\item two copper centers, CuA and CuB
\end{itemize}
\item the cytochrome a3 and CuB form a binuclear center that is the site of oxygen reduction.
\item receives an electron from four cytochrome c molecules and transfers them to one O\(_{\text{2}}\) molecule
\end{itemize}

{\small\ce{4Fe^{2+}-cyt c + 8H^{+}_{in} + O2 ->[CIV] 4Fe^{3+}-cyt c + 2H2O + 4H^{+}_{out}}}

\begin{itemize}
\item In the process binds four protons from the inner aqueous phase to
make two water molecules, and translocates another four protons
across the membrane, increasing the transmembrane difference of
proton electrochemical potential which the ATP synthase then uses to
synthesize ATP.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\item Complex IV | Inhibitors
\label{sec:orgbf557fc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide all bind to cytochrome c
oxidase
\item Nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, can also inhibit COX by
binding to regulatory sites on the enzyme
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Complex V}
\label{sec:orgf14ab11}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complex V | ATP synthase
\label{sec:org657d8d1}

\begin{itemize}
\item ATP synthase is a molecular machine that creates the energy storage
molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

\item The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is:
\end{itemize}

{\small\ce{ADP + P_i + H+_{out} <=> ATP + H2O + H+_{in}}}


\begin{itemize}
\item Formation of ATP from ADP and P\(_{\text{i}}\) is energetically unfavourable
\begin{itemize}
\item would normally proceed in the reverse direction.
\end{itemize}

\item To drive this reaction forward, ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis
to the electrochemical gradient (\(\Delta \Psi\)M) created by complexes
I,III and IV

\item ATP synthase consists of two main subunits, FO and F1, which has a
rotational motor mechanism allowing for ATP production.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{\label{fig:org8decc63}
Complex V | ATP synthase}
\end{figure}


{\small\ce{ADP + Pi + H+_{out} <=> ATP + H2O + H+_{in}}}

\item Complex V Inhibitors
\label{sec:orga7d8db3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Oligomycin A inhibits ATP synthase by blocking its proton channel
(Fo subunit), which is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation of
ADP to ATP (energy production).
\item The inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin A will significantly
reduce electron flow through the electron transport chain; however,
electron flow is not stopped completely due to a process known as
proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling.
\begin{itemize}
\item This process is due to facilitated diffusion of protons into the
mitochondrial matrix through an uncoupling protein such as
thermogenin, or UCP1.
\end{itemize}

\item Administering oligomycin to an individual can result in very high
levels of lactate accumulating in the blood and urine.

\section{Ketogenesis and Ketolysis}
\label{sec:org601968d}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org50eb6d9}

\begin{itemize}
\item During fasting, ketone bodies (KB) are an important fuel for many
tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle.
\item particularly important for the brain, which cannot oxidise fatty acids.
\item The principal KB, acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate, are
maintained in equilibrium by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
\item acetone is formed from acetoacetate non-enzymatically and eliminated in breath.
\item KB are formed in liver mitochondria, predominantly from fatty acids,
but also certain amino acids, such as leucine.
\item KB can cross cell membranes (to leave hepat ocytes and enter target
cells) by diffusion or facilitated by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
\begin{itemize}
\item MCT1 transport appears to be important during catabolic stress,
when the flux is much greater.
\end{itemize}
\item For use as fuel KB are converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues.
\item One ketolytic enzyme, mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
knownas Î²-ketothiolase or T2), is also involved in isoleucine catabolism
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{\label{fig:org490a3b2}
Ketogenesis and Ketolysis}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Disorders of ketone body metabolism present either in the first few
days of life or later in childhood, during an infection or some
other metabolic stress.
\item the primary aim of treatment is to prevent decompensation.
\item Fasting is avoided and a high glucose intake is maintained at times
of metabolic stress, such as infections.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ketogenesis Defects}
\label{sec:orgab29059}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are two defects of ketogenesis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA lyase deficiency
\item HMG-CoA synthase deficiency
\end{enumerate}
\item In these, decompensation leads to encephalopathy, with vomiting and
a reduced level of consciousness, often accompanied by hepatomegaly.
\item The biochemical features hypoketotic hypoglycaemia, with or without
hyperammonaemia â€“ resemble those seen in fatty acid oxidation
disorders.
\item organic acids are diagnostic in HMG-CoA lyase deficiency.
\item HMG-CoA synthase deficiency, the organic acids are characteristic
during decompensation but normal at other times.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org6ef4a71}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mitochondrial 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) Synthase Deficiency
\label{sec:org83ee3c3}
\begin{itemize}
\item presents with hypoglycaemia
\item often accompanied by coma and metabolic acidosis
\item Episodes are precipitated by infections with vomiting or poor
feeding in early childhood (5 months to 6 years of age)
\item There is usually hepatomegaly, which subsequently resolves
\item Hyperammonaemia is rare but (surprisingly) ketonuria may be present
\item Most patients recover with intravenous glucose
\end{itemize}

\item HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
\label{sec:org4e02676}
\begin{itemize}
\item presents with hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, vomiting and a
reduced level of consciousness.
\item 30\% patients, the onset is within 5 days of birth, after a short symptom-free period
\item In most others, symptoms are provoked by an infection in the first year.
\item A few patients first present later, occasionally as adults.
\item KB levels are inappropriately low but blood lactate concentrations
may be markedly elevated, particularly in neonatal onset cases.
\item Patients often have hyperammonaemia, hepatomegaly and abnormal liver
function tests and may develop pancreatitis or cardiomyopathy.
\item neurological sequelae included:
\begin{itemize}
\item epilepsy, intellectual handicap, hemiplegia or cerebral visual loss
\item magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows diffuse mild signal changes
in the cerebral white matter on T 2 -weighted images with multiple
foci of more severe signal abnormality
\end{itemize}
\item myelination may be impaired because KB are a substrate for the
synthesis of myelin cholesterol.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org45e26ad}
\begin{itemize}
\item KB are synthesised in hepatic mitochondria, primarily using
acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation
\item HMG-CoA synthase catalyses the condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA and
acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is cleaved by HMG-CoA lyase to
release acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.
\item HMG-CoA can also be derived from leucine.
\item HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA lyase deficiencies both impair
ketogenesis but HMG-CoA lyase deficiency also causes the
accumulation of intermediates of the leucine catabolic pathway.
\item During fasting, the lack of KB leads to excessive glucose
consumption and hypoglycaemia.
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org86c8db5}
\begin{itemize}
\item HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) and HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL) deficiencies are
AR
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orgc2ee687}
\begin{itemize}
\item Critical sample is important
\item If the plasma free fatty acid concentration is raised with an
inappropriately small rise in total KB it implies a defect of
ketogenesis or fatty acid oxidation 
\begin{itemize}
\item (FFA/total KB >2.5)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item HMG-CoA Synthase Deficiency
\label{sec:orgba1f7d7}
\begin{itemize}
\item During decompensation, urine contains saturated, unsaturated and
3-hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and other
metabolites, of which 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone is the most
specific.
\item plasma acylcarnitines are normal when patients are well
\begin{itemize}
\item raised during illness.
\end{itemize}
\item The diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis.
\end{itemize}

\item HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
\label{sec:org650ec49}
\begin{itemize}
\item Even when healthy, patients excrete increased quantities of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-hydroxyisovaleric, 3-methyl-glutaconic
and 3-methylglutaric acids
\item 3-methyl-crotonylglycine may also be present
\item Blood acylcarnitine analysis shows raised
3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5OH)
\item diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis or measuring HMG-CoA
lyase activity in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org8decc51}
\begin{itemize}
\item avoid fasting and maintain a high carbohydrate intake during any
metabolic stress, such as infections.
\item An intravenous infusion of glucose is required if drinks containing
glucose or glucose polymers are refused or vomited.
\item Intravenous sodium bicarbonate may be needed if there is severe
acidosis in HMG-CoA lyase deficiency.
\item A moderate protein restriction is usually recommended in HMG-CoA
lyase deficiency because of its role in leucine catabolism
\item HMG-CoA synthase deficiency has a good prognosis
\item HMG-CoA lyase deficiency have more encephalopathy as children adults
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ketolysis Defects}
\label{sec:orgfb116c1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ketone body utilisation is catalysed by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)
\item mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2)
\end{enumerate}
\item Deficiencies of SCOT, T2 or MCT1 present with episodes of ketoacidosis.
\item This is often accompanied by dehydration and decreased
consciousness.
\item Organic acids usually show characteristic abnormalities in T2
deficiency
\item no specific findings in SCOT or MCT1 deficiencies
\begin{itemize}
\item and diagnosis relies on molecular analysis
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org4faff77}
\begin{itemize}
\item Patients present with episodes of severe ketoacidosis in early childhood
\item A few patients have seizures or cardiomegaly at the time of presentation
\item Patients are healthy between episodes, with a normal blood pH
\item Decompensation triggered by fasting or an infection with poor
feeding and vomiting
\item Blood glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations are usually normal
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org248c90a}
\begin{itemize}
\item KB utilisation occurs in extrahepatic mitochondria, starting with
the transfer of coenzyme A from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate,
catalysed by SCOT.
\item This forms acetoacetyl-CoA, which is converted to acetyl-CoA by T2.
\item The second reaction can also be catalysed to some extent by
medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (T1)
\begin{itemize}
\item may explain why T2 deficient patients do not have permanent
ketosis
\end{itemize}
\item SCOT is not expressed in liver and has no role other than
ketolysis.
\item T2 is expressed in liver, involved in ketogenesis
\item Patients with T2 deficiency present with ketoacidosis
\begin{itemize}
\item T2 more crucial in ketolysis than in ketogenesis
\end{itemize}
\item T2 also cleaves 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA in the isoleucine
degradation pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item T2 deficiency \(\to\) \(\uparrow\) isoleucine-derived acyl-CoA esters
\item these may be responsible for neurodevelopmental abnormalities
\end{itemize}
\item ketoacidosis in patients with MCT1 deficiency \(\to\) transporters are
facilitate rapid entry of KB at times of stress.
\item MCT1 transporters are important for lactate transport
\begin{itemize}
\item expressed in the brain, particularly on oligodendroglia.
\end{itemize}
\item learning difficulties in MCT1 deficient patients may be due to the
absence of MCT1 in the brain
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org745b29b}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR - SCOT (OXCT1), T2 (ACAT1) and MCT1 (SLC16A1)
\item Heterozygous SLC16A1 and OXCT1 mutations have, however, been found
in severalpatients investigated for ketoacidosis, suggesting that
they can cause problems if subjects are exposed to sufficient stress.

\item Heterozygous SLC16A1 mutations can also cause hyperinsulinism;
these patients have promoter mutations that prevent the normal
silencing of MCT1 expression in pancreatic \(\beta\)-cells
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org466a473}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SCOT \& MCT1 Deficiencies
\label{sec:org96581fe}
\begin{itemize}
\item should be considered in a number of patients because ketoacidosis is relatively common
\item A plasma free fatty acid:
\begin{itemize}
\item total KB ratio <0.3 suggests a defect of ketolysis.
\end{itemize}
\item Urine organic acid analysis reveals high concentrations of KB but no
specific abnormalities.
\item Patients with severe SCOT deficiency have persistent ketonuria in
the fed state, but patients with a mild mutation do not
\item The diagnoses are now usually made by mutation analysis
\end{itemize}
\item T2 Deficiency
\label{sec:org9391c73}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) urine 2-methylacetoacetate, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid
and tiglylglycine.
\begin{itemize}
\item 2-methylacetoacetate is unstable
\end{itemize}
\item patient with mild mutations may only show abnormalities when they
are stressed (e.g isoleucine load)
\item 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causes a
similar pattern of organic acids but 2-methyacetoacetate is not excreted
\item diagnosis must be confirmed by mutation analysis or enzyme assay in fibroblasts.
\begin{itemize}
\item Assays are complicated by the presence of other thiolases that act
on acetoacetyl-CoA.
\end{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine and
tiglylcarnitine on plasma acylcarnitine
\begin{itemize}
\item may be normal with mild mutations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org862a015}
\begin{itemize}
\item same as ketogenesis defects above
\item T2 involved in isoleucine met, \(\therefore\) \(\downarrow\) protein
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Creatine Deficiency}
\label{sec:org9632a1d}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org40dc755}

\begin{itemize}
\item Creatine is synthesized by two enzymatic reactions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, GATM) catalyses the
transfer of an amidino group from arginine to glycine, yielding
guanidinoacetate
\item S-adenosyl-L-methionine:N-guanidinoacetatemethyltransferase
(GAMT, GAMT) catalyses the methylation of the amidino group in
the guanidino-acetate molecule, yielding creatine.
\end{enumerate}

\item Creatine synthesis occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in the kidney
and in the pancreas, which have high AGAT activity, and in the
liver, which has high GAMT activity.

\item From these organs of synthesis, creatine is transported via the
bloodstream to the organs of utilization (mainly muscle and brain)
\begin{itemize}
\item where both the endogenously synthetized creatine as well as the
creatine derived from dietary sources is taken up by a sodium and
chloride dependent creatine transporter (CRTR,SLC6A8).
\end{itemize}

\item The major proportion of brain creatine is taken up from the blood
via CRTR expressed at blood-brain barrier.

\item A minor proportion is synthesized in the brain.

\item Part of intracellular creatine is reversibly converted into the
high-energy compound creatine-phosphate, by the action of creatine
kinase (CK).

\item Three cytosolic isoforms of CK (brain type BB-CK, muscle type MM-CK
and the MB-CK heterodimer), and two mitochondrial isoforms exist.

\item Creatine and creatine-phosphate are non-enzymatically converted into
creatinine, with a constant daily turnover of 1.5\% of body
creatine.

\item Creatinine is mainly excreted in urine and its daily excretion is
directly proportional to total body creatine, and in particular to
muscle mass
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Creatine Deficiency Syndromes}
\label{sec:orgc06b081}
\begin{itemize}
\item Creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) are a group of inborn errors of
creatine synthesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency
\item guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item and transport:
\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked creatine transporter CRTR deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item CDS typically present with global developmental delay/ intellectual
disability along with various neurological
manifestations.
\item Diagnostic markers include:
\item cerebral creatine deficiency
\item \(\uparrow\) guanidinoacetate in GAMT
\item \(\downarrow\) guanidinoacetate in AGAT
\item \(\uparrow\) urinary creatine/creatinine in CRTR deficiency.
\item Oral supplementation of creatine leads to near complete restoration
of cerebral creatine in creatine synthesis defects
\item In GAMT deficiency, reduction of guanidinoacetate is achieved by
ornithine supplementation \textpm{} dietary arginine restriction.
\item In CRTR deficiency, creatine, arginine and glycine supplementation
does not significantly improve outcome, although partial clinical
improvement has been reported in single patients.
\item Normal neurodevelopmental outcome has been reported in early treated
patients with creatine synthesis defects.
\item Secondary changes in creatine metabolism have been described in
disorders affecting arginine and ornithine metabolism including:
\begin{itemize}
\item ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) deficiency
\item urea cycle defects
\item hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome
\item \(\delta\)(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency
\item defects of methylcobalamin synthesis
\item mitochondrial disease
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org8a66e46}
\begin{itemize}
\item global developmental delay (GDD) /intellectual disability (ID) with
prominent speech delay.
\item GDD or ID ranges from mild to severe and is characteristically
associated with challenging (hyperactive, autistic) behaviours.
\item Movement disorders and basal ganglia changes are additional features
in GAMT deficiency.
\item Myopathy is an additional feature of AGAT deficiency.
\item Epilepsy occurs in GAMT and CRTR deficiencies.
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org608f48e}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cerebral  creatine  deficiency is  caused  by  reduced synthesis  of
creatine in AGAT and GAMT deficiency  or by impaired uptake into the
brain in CRTR deficiency.
\item Low intracellular creatine and creatine-phosphate result in reduced
production of creatinine
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) \low urine and plasma creatinine
\end{itemize}
\item Guanidinoacetate is neurotoxic \(\to\) CNS
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) AGAT deficiency
\item \(\uparrow\) GAMT deficiency
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Genetics
\label{sec:orgce08289}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR, AGAT (GATM) and GAMT (GAMT)
\item X-linked, CRTC (SLC6A8)
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org506b6cf}
\begin{itemize}
\item MRS to screen for cerebral creatine deficiency
\item urine guanidinoacetate, creatine and creatinine is an important
screening test for all CDS
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) AGAT, \(\le\) 10\% of LLN
\item \(\uparrow\) GAMT , 10x normal
\end{itemize}
\item CSF guanidinoacetate
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) GAMT, 100x normal
\end{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) urine creatinine/creatine in CRTR 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Treatment
\label{sec:orge99c8e2}
\begin{itemize}
\item AGAT and GAMT treated wtih creatine monohydrate
\item CRTC no treatment
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
