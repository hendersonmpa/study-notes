* Introduction

- During fasting, ketone bodies (KB) are an important fuel for many
  tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle.
- particularly important for the brain, which cannot oxidise fatty acids.
- The principal KB, acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate, are
  maintained in equilibrium by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
- acetone is formed from acetoacetate non-enzymatically and eliminated in breath.
- KB are formed in liver mitochondria, predominantly from fatty acids,
  but also certain amino acids, such as leucine.
- KB can cross cell membranes (to leave hepat ocytes and enter target
  cells) by diffusion or facilitated by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
  - MCT1 transport appears to be important during catabolic stress,
    when the flux is much greater.
- For use as fuel KB are converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues.
- One ketolytic enzyme, mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
  knownas β-ketothiolase or T2), is also involved in isoleucine catabolism

- Disorders of ketone body metabolism present either in the first few
  days of life or later in childhood, during an infection or some
  other metabolic stress.
- the primary aim of treatment is to prevent decompensation.
- Fasting is avoided and a high glucose intake is maintained at times
  of metabolic stress, such as infections.

- There are two defects of ketogenesis:
  1. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA lyase deficiency
  2. HMG-CoA synthase deficiency
- In these, decompensation leads to encephalopathy, with vomiting and
  a reduced level of consciousness, often accompanied by hepatomegaly.
- The biochemical features hypoketotic hypoglycaemia, with or without
  hyperammonaemia – resemble those seen in fatty acid oxidation
  disorders.
- organic acids are diagnostic in HMG-CoA lyase deficiency.
- HMG-CoA synthase deficiency, the organic acids are characteristic
  during decompensation but normal at other times.
* Ketogenesis Defects
** Clinical Presentatio
*** Mitochondrial 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) Synthase Deficiency
- presents with hypoglycaemia
- often accompanied by coma and metabolic acidosis
- Episodes are precipitated by infections with vomiting or poor
  feeding in early childhood (5 months to 6 years of age)
- There is usually hepatomegaly, which subsequently resolves
- Hyperammonaemia is rare but (surprisingly) ketonuria may be present
- Most patients recover with intravenous glucose

*** HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
- presents with hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, vomiting and a
  reduced level of consciousness.
- 30% patients, the onset is within 5 days of birth, after a short symptom-free period
- In most others, symptoms are provoked by an infection in the first year.
- A few patients first present later, occasionally as adults.
- KB levels are inappropriately low but blood lactate concentrations
  may be markedly elevated, particularly in neonatal onset cases.
- Patients often have hyperammonaemia, hepatomegaly and abnormal liver
  function tests and may develop pancreatitis or cardiomyopathy. 
- neurological sequelae included:
  - epilepsy, intellectual handicap, hemiplegia or cerebral visual loss
  - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows diffuse mild signal changes
    in the cerebral white matter on T 2 -weighted images with multiple
    foci of more severe signal abnormality
- myelination may be impaired because KB are a substrate for the
  synthesis of myelin cholesterol.

** Metabolic Derangment
- KB are synthesised in hepatic mitochondria, primarily using
  acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation
- HMG-CoA synthase catalyses the condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA and
  acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is cleaved by HMG-CoA lyase to
  release acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.
- HMG-CoA can also be derived from leucine.
- HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA lyase deficiencies both impair
  ketogenesis but HMG-CoA lyase deficiency also causes the
  accumulation of intermediates of the leucine catabolic pathway.
- During fasting, the lack of KB leads to excessive glucose
  consumption and hypoglycaemia.

** Genetics
- HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) and HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL) deficiencies are
  AR

** Diagnostic Tests
- Critical sample is important
- If the plasma free fatty acid concentration is raised with an
  inappropriately small rise in total KB it implies a defect of
  ketogenesis or fatty acid oxidation 
  - (FFA/total KB >2.5)

*** HMG-CoA Synthase Deficiency
- During decompensation, urine contains saturated, unsaturated and
  3-hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and other
  metabolites, of which 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone is the most
  specific.
- plasma acylcarnitines are normal when patients are well
  - raised during illness.
- The diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis.

*** HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
- Even when healthy, patients excrete increased quantities of
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-hydroxyisovaleric, 3-methyl-glutaconic
  and 3-methylglutaric acids
- 3-methyl-crotonylglycine may also be present
- Blood acylcarnitine analysis shows raised
  3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5OH)
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis or measuring HMG-CoA
  lyase activity in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts.

** Treatment
- avoid fasting and maintain a high carbohydrate intake during any
  metabolic stress, such as infections.
- An intravenous infusion of glucose is required if drinks containing
  glucose or glucose polymers are refused or vomited.
- Intravenous sodium bicarbonate may be needed if there is severe
  acidosis in HMG-CoA lyase deficiency.
- A moderate protein restriction is usually recommended in HMG-CoA
  lyase deficiency because of its role in leucine catabolism
- HMG-CoA synthase deficiency has a good prognosis
- HMG-CoA lyase deficiency have more encephalopathy as children adults

* Ketolysis Defects

- Ketone body utilisation is catalysed by:
  1. succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)
  2. mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2)
- Deficiencies of SCOT, T2 or MCT1 present with episodes of ketoacidosis.
- This is often accompanied by dehydration and decreased
  consciousness.
- Organic acids usually show characteristic abnormalities in T2
  deficiency
- no specific findings in SCOT or MCT1 deficiencies
  - and diagnosis relies on molecular analysis
