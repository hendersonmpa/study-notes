* Introduction

- During fasting, ketone bodies (KB) are an important fuel for many
  tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle
- particularly important for the brain, which cannot oxidise fatty acids
- The principal KB, acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate, are
  maintained in equilibrium by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
- acetone is formed from acetoacetate non-enzymatically and eliminated in breath
- formed in liver mitochondria from fatty acids and certain amino acids(e.g. leucine)
- cross cell membranes by diffusion or facilitated by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
  - MCT1 transport is important during catabolic stress, \uparrow flux
- converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues for use as fuel
- One ketolytic enzyme, mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (AKA
  /beta-ketothiolase or T2), is also involved in isoleucine catabolism

- Disorders of ketone body metabolism present either in the first few
  days of life or later in childhood, during an infection or some
  other metabolic stress.
- the primary aim of treatment is to prevent decompensation.
- Fasting is avoided and a high glucose intake is maintained at times
  of metabolic stress, such as infections.

* Ketogenesis Defects
- There are two defects of ketogenesis:
  1. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA lyase deficiency
  2. HMG-CoA synthase deficiency

** Clinical Presentation
*** Mitochondrial 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) Synthase Deficiency
- presents with hypoglycaemia
  - often accompanied by coma and metabolic acidosis
  - precipitated by infections with vomiting or poor feeding in early
    childhood (5 months to 6 years of age)
- usually hepatomegaly, which resolves
- Hyperammonaemia is rare, (surprisingly) ketonuria may be present
- Most patients recover with intravenous glucose

*** HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
- presents with hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, vomiting and a
  reduced level of consciousness
- 30% patients, the onset is within 5 days of birth, after a short symptom-free period
- ~70% patients, symptoms are provoked by an infection in the first year
- A few patients first present later, occasionally as adults
- KB levels are inappropriately low blood lactate concentrations
  may be markedly elevated, particularly in neonatal onset cases
- often hyperammonaemia, hepatomegaly and abnormal liver function tests and
  may develop pancreatitis or cardiomyopathy
- neurological sequelae included:
  - epilepsy, intellectual handicap, hemiplegia or cerebral visual loss
  - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows diffuse mild signal changes
    in the cerebral white matter on T 2 -weighted images with multiple
    foci of more severe signal abnormality
- myelination may be impaired because KB are a substrate for the
  synthesis of myelin cholesterol.

** Metabolic Derangement
- KB are synthesised in hepatic mitochondria, primarily using
  acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation
- HMG-CoA synthase catalyses the condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA and
  acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is cleaved by HMG-CoA lyase to
  release acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.
- HMG-CoA can also be derived from leucine.
- HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA lyase deficiencies both impair
  ketogenesis but HMG-CoA lyase deficiency also causes the
  accumulation of intermediates of the leucine catabolic pathway.
- During fasting, the lack of KB leads to excessive glucose
  consumption and hypoglycaemia.

** Genetics
- HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) and HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL) deficiencies are
  AR

** Diagnostic Tests
- Critical sample is important
- If the plasma free fatty acid concentration is raised with an
  inappropriately small rise in total KB it implies a defect of
  ketogenesis or fatty acid oxidation 
  - plasma FFA/total KB >2.5

*** HMG-CoA Synthase Deficiency
- During decompensation, urine contains saturated, unsaturated and
  3-hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and other
  metabolites, of which 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone is the most
  specific.
- plasma acylcarnitines are normal when patients are well
  - raised during illness.
- The diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis.

*** HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
- Even when healthy, patients excrete increased quantities of
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-hydroxyisovaleric, 3-methyl-glutaconic
  and 3-methylglutaric acids
- 3-methyl-crotonylglycine may also be present
- Blood acylcarnitine analysis shows raised
  3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5OH)
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis or measuring HMG-CoA
  lyase activity in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts.

** Treatment
- avoid fasting and maintain  high carbohydrate intake during any
  metabolic stress, such as infections
- IV glucose is required if drinks containing if not oral intake or vomiting
- IV sodium bicarbonate may be needed if there is severe acidosis in
  HMG-CoA lyase deficiency
- moderate protein restriction is usually recommended in HMG-CoA
  lyase deficiency because of its role in leucine catabolism
- HMG-CoA synthase deficiency has a good prognosis
- HMG-CoA lyase deficiency have more encephalopathy as children or adults

* Ketolysis Defects
- Ketone body utilisation is catalysed by:
  1. succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)
  2. mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2)
- Deficiencies of SCOT, T2 or MCT1 present with episodes of ketoacidosis.

** Clinical Presentation
- Patients present with episodes of severe ketoacidosis in early childhood
- A few patients have seizures or cardiomegaly at the time of presentation
- Patients are healthy between episodes, with normal blood pH
- Decompensation triggered by fasting or an infection with poor
  feeding and vomiting
- Blood glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations are usually normal

** Metabolic Derangement
- KB utilisation occurs in extrahepatic mitochondria, starting with
  the transfer of coenzyme A from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate,
  catalysed by SCOT.
- This forms acetoacetyl-CoA, which is converted to acetyl-CoA by T2.
- The second reaction can also be catalysed to some extent by
  medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (T1)
  - may explain why T2 deficient patients do not have permanent
    ketosis
- SCOT is not expressed in liver and has no role other than
  ketolysis.
- T2 is expressed in liver, involved in ketogenesis and ketolysis
- Patients with T2 deficiency present with ketoacidosis
  - T2 more crucial in ketolysis than in ketogenesis
- T2 also cleaves 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA in the isoleucine
  degradation pathway
  - T2 deficiency \to \uparrow isoleucine-derived acyl-CoA esters
  - these may be responsible for neurodevelopmental abnormalities
- ketoacidosis in patients with MCT1 deficiency \to transporters are
  facilitate rapid entry of KB at times of stress.
- MCT1 transporters are important for lactate transport
  - expressed in the brain, particularly on oligodendroglia.
- learning difficulties in MCT1 deficient patients may be due to the
  absence of MCT1 in the brain

** Genetics
- AR - SCOT (OXCT1), T2 (ACAT1) and MCT1 (SLC16A1)
- Heterozygous SLC16A1 and OXCT1 mutations have, however, been found
  in several patients investigated for ketoacidosis, suggesting that
  they can cause problems if subjects are exposed to sufficient stress.

- Heterozygous SLC16A1 mutations can also cause hyperinsulinism;
 these patients have promoter mutations that prevent the normal
 silencing of MCT1 expression in pancreatic \beta-cells

** Diagnostic Tests
*** SCOT & MCT1 Deficiencies
- should be considered in a number of patients because ketoacidosis is relatively common
- A plasma free fatty acid:
  - plasma FFA/total KB <0.3 suggests a defect of ketolysis
- Urine organic acids show \uparrow KB but no specific abnormalities.
- Patients with severe SCOT deficiency have persistent ketonuria in
  the fed state, but patients with a mild mutation do not
- The diagnoses are now usually made by mutation analysis
*** T2 Deficiency
- \uparrow urine 2-methylacetoacetate, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid
  and tiglylglycine.
  - 2-methylacetoacetate is unstable
- patient with mild mutations may only show abnormalities when they
  are stressed (e.g isoleucine load)
- 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causes a
  similar pattern of organic acids but 2-methyacetoacetate is not excreted
- diagnosis must be confirmed by mutation analysis or enzyme assay in fibroblasts.
  - Assays are complicated by the presence of other thiolases that act
    on acetoacetyl-CoA.
- \uparrow 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine and
  tiglylcarnitine on plasma acylcarnitine
  - may be normal with mild mutations

** Treatment
- same as ketogenesis defects above
- T2 involved in isoleucine met, \therefore \downarrow protein
