\section{Fatty Acid Oxidation}
\label{sec:orgdd6e62f}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgdf2c17b}
\begin{itemize}
\item fatty acids are usually straight aliphatic chains with a methyl
group at one end (\(\omega\)-carbon) and a carboxyl group at the other
end
\end{itemize}

\definesubmol{x}{-[1,.6]-[7,.6]}
\definesubmol{a}{-[1,.6]\beta{}-[7,.6]\alpha{}}

\chemname{\chemfig{\omega{}!b-[1]C(=[1]O)-[7]O{^-}}}{stearic acid 18:0}

\begin{itemize}
\item non-systematic historical names most commonly used
\begin{description}
\item[{Palmitic acid}] C16:0 discovered in palm oil
\item[{Stearic acid}] C18:0 from the Greek word "stear", which means tallow
\item[{Oleic acid}] C18:1 oleic means related to, or derived from, olive oil
\end{description}
\item position of a double bond is designated by the number of the carbon in the double bond that is closest to the carboxyl group
\end{itemize}

\definesubmol{x}{-[1,.6]-[7,.6]}
\definesubmol{y}{-[7,.6]-[1,.6]}
\definesubmol{d}{=[0,.6](-[7,0.25,,,draw=none]\scriptstyle\color{red}9)-[1,.6]}

\begin{itemize}
\item oleic acid - 18:1,\(\Delta^{\text{9}}\)
\begin{itemize}
\item 18:1 - 18 carbons and 1 double bond
\item \(\Delta^{\text{9}}\) - double bond between 9th and 10th carbon
\begin{itemize}
\item also 18:1(9)
\item distance from \(\omega\) methyl group, \(\omega\)-9
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item fatty acid chain length:
\begin{description}
\item[{very long-chain}] > C20
\item[{long-chain}] C12-C20
\item[{medium-chain}] C6-C12
\item[{short-chain}] C4
\end{description}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
\label{sec:org6499372}

\begin{itemize}
\item involves three processes (Figure \ref{fig:orgc0c997e})
\begin{enumerate}
\item entry of fatty acids into mitochondria
\begin{itemize}
\item long-chain fatty acids are activated to coenzyme A (CoA) esters
in the cytoplasm
\item need to be transferred to carnitine to cross the inner
mitochondrial membrane
\item they are transferred back to CoA within the mitochondria
\item CPT I is the main site for the regulation of fatty acid
oxidation by cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA
\item medium and short-chain fatty acids enter mitochondria
independent of carnitine and are activated to CoA esters in the
matrix
\end{itemize}
\item \(\beta\)-oxidation via a spiral pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item each turn of the spiral shortens the acyl-CoA by two carbons and involves four steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item two dehydrogenation reactions linked respectively to FAD and NAD
\end{itemize}
\item \(\beta\)-oxidation is catalysed by enzymes of different chain
length specificity
\item enzymes for long-chain substrates are membrane-bound
\begin{itemize}
\item three of the reactions are catalysed by the mitochondrial
trifunctional protein (MTP)
\item medium and short-chain enzymes are located in the matrix
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item electron transfer
\begin{itemize}
\item electrons are passed to the respiratory chain either directly
(from NADH to complex I) or via two transfer proteins (from
FADH\(_{\text{2}}\) to ubiquinone)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\item Common manifestations in FAODs
\label{sec:orga88564f}
\begin{itemize}
\item fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
\begin{itemize}
\item primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
\item hepatic glucose output is also reduced under some conditions
\end{itemize}
\item the hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic
\begin{itemize}
\item ketone bodies can be synthesised
\begin{itemize}
\item medium-or short-chain FAODs or if there is high residual enzyme activity
\item plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or the plasma free fatty acid concentrations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects
\begin{itemize}
\item with normal or low glutamine concentrations
\item decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate
\end{itemize}
\item lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
\begin{itemize}
\item inhibitory effects of metabolites on pyruvate metabolism
\end{itemize}
\item moderate hyperuricaemia - frequent finding during acute attacks
\item secondary hyperprolinaemia occurs in some babies with MAD deficiency
\item accumulating long-chain acylcarnitines may be responsible for
arrhythmias and may interfere with surfactant metabolism
\item in LCHAD and MTP deficiencies, long chain hydroxy-acylcarnitine
concentrations correlate with the severity of retinopathy and may
cause both this and the peripheral neuropathy
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Carnitine Cycle Defects}
\label{sec:org514eb6e}
\begin{itemize}
\item carnitine-mediated transport of fatty acids is rate-limiting in the
oxidation of fats
\item a defect anywhere in the pathway would be expected to lead to
inadequate formation of ketone bodies in response to fasting along
with inadequate gluconeogenesis and hypoglycemia.
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Carnitine Transporter Deficiency
\label{sec:org87adb73}
\begin{itemize}
\item AKA: primary carnitine deficiency, carnitine uptake deficiency
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org423a8bc}
\begin{itemize}
\item cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, muscle weakness, liver disease
\item precipitated by infection, fasting, pregnancy or antibiotics containing pivalate
\begin{itemize}
\item pivalate is excreted bound to carnitine \(\to\) \(\downarrow\) carnitine concentration
\begin{itemize}
\item isobaric with C5-carnitine
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item some present in infancy with hypoglycaemia, liver dysfunction and hyperammonaemia
\item other children develop heart failure due to cardiomyopathy,
thickened ventricular walls and reduced contractility
\item often accompanied by skeletal muscle weakness
\item adults may suffer fatigue or arrhythmias
\item screening has shown that many subjects with low plasma carnitine remain asymptomatic
\end{itemize}
\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org2e2d025}
\begin{itemize}
\item organic cation/carnitine transporter(OCTN2) responsible for
carnitine uptake (Figure \ref{fig:org0ff4669})
\begin{itemize}
\item analysis of carnitine transport in different tissues suggests the
presence of heterogeneous transporters
\item liver and brain have a low-affinity (K\(_{\text{M}}\)=2-10 uM), high-capacity transporter
\item fibroblast, muscle, and heart cells have a high-affinity (K\(_{\text{M}}\)=5-10 uM), low-capacity system
\end{itemize}
\item defects \(\to\) primary carnitine deficiency with \(\uparrow\) renal loss of carnitine
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) plasma concentrations
\item \(\downarrow\) intracellular concentrations \(\to\) impair fatty acid
oxidation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency
\label{sec:org465ca20}

\item usually present by the age of 2 years with hypoketotic hypoglycaemia
\begin{itemize}
\item induced by fasting or illness
\end{itemize}
\item accompanied by hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction and occasionally cholestasis
\begin{itemize}
\item may also be transient lipaemia and renal tubular acidosis
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org6a09f15}
\begin{itemize}
\item CPT1 is responsible for the formation of acyl carnitines
\begin{itemize}
\item catalyzes transfer of the acyl group of a long-chain fatty
acyl-CoA from coenzyme A to l-carnitine
\item allows for subsequent movement of the acyl carnitine from the
cytosol into the intermembrane space of mitochondria
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{CPTIa} liver and kidney
\item \textbf{CPTIb}  muscle and heart
\item \textbf{CPTIc}  brain
\item only CPTIa deficiency has been identified
\item medium chain and short chain fatty acids pass directly into
mitochondria and do not require esterification with carnitine
\item CPT II is situated on the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes
the regeneration of carnitine and the long chain fatty acyl CoAs,
which then undergo \(\beta\)-oxidation
\end{itemize}

\item CPTI deficiency is extremely common in the Inuit population of Canada and Greenland
\begin{itemize}
\item c.1436C>T, P479L
\end{itemize}
\item a few of these patients present with hypoglycaemia as neonates or young children
\begin{itemize}
\item most remain asymptomatic
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Testing
\label{sec:orgde80896}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) total/free carnitine
\item \(\uparrow\) C0
\item \(\downarrow\) C16, C18, C18:1
\end{itemize}
\item Treatment
\label{sec:org03e583c}
\begin{itemize}
\item prevent hypoglycaemia
\item low-fat diet
\item medium-chain triglycerides to provide \(\sim\) 1/3 total calories
\begin{itemize}
\item C6-C10 fatty acids do not require the carnitine shuttle for entry into the mitochondrion
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Carnitine Acylcarnitine Translocase Deficiency
\label{sec:orgb402804}

\begin{itemize}
\item rare disorder usually presents in the neonatal period, with
death by 3 months of age
\begin{itemize}
\item severe hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia, cardiomyopathy,
atrioventricular block and ventricular arrhythmias
\end{itemize}
\item few more mildly affected patients present later with hypoglycaemic
encephalopathy
\begin{itemize}
\item precipitated by fasting or infections
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org75e5dfa}
\begin{itemize}
\item carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase, catalyzes the transfer of the
acylcarnitines across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Figure \ref{fig:org366de2d})
\item deficiency of carnitine acyl translocase leads to the accumulation
of the free fatty acids outside the mitochondrial matrix
\item long chain acylcarnitines and short chains are also found, because
translocase catalyzes the transport of short as well as long chain
acylcarnitines
\item \(\Uparrow\) long chain acyl carnitines during illness and fasting
induced lipolysis
\item \(\uparrow\) medium and short chain esters might reflect the acyl CoA products
of peroxisomal oxidation that would require transfer into the
mitochondria via the translocase for final oxidation
\item secondary deficiency of free carnitine would be expected to result
from the excretion over time of large amounts of esterified
carnitine
\end{itemize}

\section{Oxidative Phosphorylation}
\label{sec:org123576f}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org7942497}
\begin{itemize}
\item responsible for ATP production
\item ETC complexes I-IV
\item OxPhos system complexes I-V
\item oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which ATP is formed as a
result of the transfer of electrons from NADH or FADH\(_{\text{2}}\) to O\(_{\text{2}}\) by a
series of electron carriers (Figure \ref{fig:org060ca1f})
\item this process, which takes place in mitochondria, is the major source
of ATP in aerobic organisms

\item \textasciitilde{} 90 subunits
\item 13 subunits of Complexes I, III, IV and V encoded by mtDNA (Table \ref{tab:org17dfcaa})
\item mitochondrial replication, transcription and translation
\item require \textgreater{} 200 proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs
\item cofactors: coenzyme Q\(_{\text{10}}\), iron-sulfur clusters, heme, copper
\begin{itemize}
\item require synthesis and/or transport to OxPhos system
\end{itemize}
\item cardiolipin required for cristae formation
\item mitochondrial function
\begin{itemize}
\item protein import, turnover
\item fission, fusion
\end{itemize}
\item \textgreater{} 1500 proteins in the human mitochondrial proteome
\begin{itemize}
\item other additional factors - lipids, cofactors
\item up to 10\% of human proteome may have role in maintaining mitochondrial function
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item the ETC and OxPhos are coupled by a proton gradient across the IMM
\begin{itemize}
\item the efflux of protons from the mitochondrial matrix creates an electrochemical gradient
\begin{itemize}
\item used by the F\(_{\text{0}}\)F\(_{\text{1}}\) ATP synthase complex to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item energy from transfer of electrons down the ETC is used to pump
protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space
\begin{itemize}
\item creates an electrochemical proton gradient (\DeltapH) across the IMM
\begin{itemize}
\item largely responsible for the mitochondrial membrane potential (\(\Delta \Psi\)M)
\end{itemize}
\item ATP synthase uses flow of \ce{H+} through the enzyme back into the
matrix to generate ATP from ADP and Pi
\end{itemize}
\item there are three energy-transducing enzymes in the electron transport
chain:
\begin{itemize}
\item NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I)
\item Coenzyme Q – cytochrome c reductase (complex III)
\item cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV)
\item also ETF-QO and mitochondrial GPD
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./oxphos/figures/etc.pdf}

Electron Transport Chain}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Complex I (NADH coenzyme Q reductase) accepts electrons from the
Krebs cycle electron carrier NADH
\item passes them to CoQ (ubiquinone)
\item CoQ also receives electrons from complex II (succinate dehydrogenase)
\item CoQ passes electrons to complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex), which
passes them to cytochrome c
\item Cyt c passes electrons to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), which
uses the electrons and hydrogen ions to reduce molecular oxygen to
water
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item mechanism: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item seven iron sulfur centers carry electrons from the site of NADH
oxidation to ubiquinone

\item the energy from the redox reaction results in conformational
change allowing hydrogen ions to pass through four transmembrane
helix channels

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle
\label{sec:org1bc070d}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item 2 core proteins
\item 6 low-molecular weight proteins

{\small\ce{QH2 + 2Fe^{3+}-cyt c + 2H+_{in} ->[CIII]  Q + 2Fe^{2+}-cyt c + 4H+_{out}}}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Inhibitors
\label{sec:org3e25f28}
\begin{itemize}
\item there are three distinct groups of Complex III inhibitors:
\begin{itemize}
\item antimycin A binds to the Q\(_{\text{i}}\) site and inhibits the transfer of electrons in Complex III from heme b\(_{\text{H}}\) to oxidized Q (Q\(_{\text{i}}\) site inhibitor)
\item myxothiazol and stigmatellin bind to distinct but overlapping pockets within the Q\(_{\text{o}}\) site
\begin{itemize}
\item myxothiazol binds nearer to cytochrome bL (hence termed a "proximal" inhibitor)
\item stigmatellin binds farther from heme bL and nearer the Rieske Iron sulfur protein
\item both inhibit the transfer of electrons from reduced QH\(_{\text{2}}\) to the Rieske Iron sulfur protein
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Complex IV
\label{sec:orgc89ce01}
\begin{itemize}
\item AKA Cytochrome c oxidase
\item last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain
\item large IMM integral membrane protein composed of several metal prosthetic sites and 14 protein subunits
\item eleven subunits are nuclear in origin, and three are synthesized in the mitochondria
\begin{itemize}
\item contains two hemes

\begin{itemize}
\item binds four protons from the inner aqueous phase to make two water
molecules, and translocates another four protons across the
membrane, increasing the transmembrane difference of proton
electrochemical potential which the ATP synthase then uses to
synthesize ATP
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Inhibitors
\label{sec:org9361ccd}
\begin{itemize}
\item cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide all bind to cytochrome c
oxidase
\item nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, can also inhibit COX by
binding to regulatory sites on the enzyme
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Complex V
\label{sec:orgcbd8349}
\begin{itemize}
\item AKA ATP synthase
\item ATP synthase is a molecular machine that creates the energy storage
molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
\item overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is:
\end{itemize}

{\small\ce{ADP + P_i + H+_{out} <=>[CV] ATP + H2O + H+_{in}}}

\begin{itemize}
\item formation of ATP from ADP and P\(_{\text{i}}\) is energetically unfavourable
\begin{itemize}
\item would normally proceed in the reverse direction
\end{itemize}

\item to drive this reaction forward, ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis
to the electrochemical gradient (\(\Delta \Psi\)M) created by complexes
I,III and IV

\item ATP synthase consists of two main subunits, F\(_{\text{0}}\) and F\(_{\text{1}}\), which has a
rotational motor mechanism allowing for ATP production

Complex V | ATP synthase}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Complex V Inhibitors
\label{sec:org994fd81}
\begin{itemize}
\item Oligomycin A inhibits ATP synthase by blocking its proton channel
(F\(_{\text{0}}\) subunit), which is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation of
ADP to ATP (energy production)
\item The inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin A will significantly
reduce electron flow through the electron transport chain; however,
electron flow is not stopped completely due to a process known as
proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling
\begin{itemize}
\item This process is due to facilitated diffusion of protons into the
mitochondrial matrix through an uncoupling protein such as
thermogenin, or UCP1
\end{itemize}

\item Administering oligomycin to an individual can result in very high
levels of lactate accumulating in the blood and urine
\end{itemize}

\section{Ketogenesis and Ketolysis}
\label{sec:org4f2eb27}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org6c3b306}
\begin{itemize}
\item during fasting, ketone bodies (KB) are an important fuel for many
tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle
\item particularly important for the brain, which cannot oxidise fatty acids
\item principal KB, acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate, are
maintained in equilibrium by 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase

\ce{acetoacetate + NADH <=>[HBDH] \betaHB + NAD+}

\item acetone is formed from acetoacetate non-enzymatically and eliminated in breath
\item formed in liver mitochondria from fatty acids and certain amino acids(e.g. leucine)
\item cross cell membranes by diffusion or facilitated by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
\begin{itemize}
\item MCT1 transport is important during catabolic stress, \(\uparrow\) flux
\end{itemize}
\item converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues for use as fuel
\item one ketolytic enzyme, mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (AKA
\(\beta\)-ketothiolase or T2), is also involved in isoleucine catabolism
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./ketones/figures/ketones.png}
\caption{\label{fig:orgd0b83e7}
Ketogenesis and Ketolysis}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item disorders of ketone body metabolism present either in the first few
days of life or later in childhood, during an infection or some
other metabolic stress
\item the primary aim of treatment is to prevent decompensation
\item fasting is avoided and a high glucose intake is maintained at times
of metabolic stress, such as infections
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ketogenesis Defects}
\label{sec:orgb21d0f6}
\begin{itemize}
\item there are two defects of ketogenesis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA lyase deficiency
\item HMG-CoA synthase deficiency
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:orgac46c65}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mitochondrial 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) Synthase Deficiency
\label{sec:org9c014a6}
\begin{itemize}
\item presents with hypoglycaemia
\begin{itemize}
\item often accompanied by coma and metabolic acidosis
\item precipitated by infections with vomiting or poor feeding in early
childhood (5 months to 6 years of age)
\end{itemize}
\item usually hepatomegaly, which resolves
\item hyperammonaemia is rare, (surprisingly) ketonuria may be present
\item most patients recover with intravenous glucose
\end{itemize}

\item HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
\label{sec:org9aa850a}
\begin{itemize}
\item presents with hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, vomiting and a
reduced level of consciousness
\item 30\% patients, the onset is within 5 days of birth, after a short symptom-free period
\item \textasciitilde{}70\% patients, symptoms are provoked by an infection in the first year
\item few patients present later, occasionally as adults
\item KB levels are inappropriately low blood lactate concentrations
may be markedly elevated, particularly in neonatal onset cases
\item often hyperammonaemia, hepatomegaly and abnormal liver function tests and
may develop pancreatitis or cardiomyopathy
\item neurological sequelae included:
\begin{itemize}
\item epilepsy, intellectual handicap, hemiplegia or cerebral visual loss
\item magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows diffuse mild signal changes
in the cerebral white matter on T 2 -weighted images with multiple
foci of more severe signal abnormality
\end{itemize}
\item myelination may be impaired because KB are a substrate for the
synthesis of myelin cholesterol
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org2a84602}
\begin{itemize}
\item KB are synthesised in hepatic mitochondria, primarily using
acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation
\item HMG-CoA synthase catalyses the condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA and
acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA, which is cleaved by HMG-CoA lyase to
release acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate
\item HMG-CoA can also be derived from leucine
\item \textbf{HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA lyase deficiencies both impair}
\textbf{ketogenesis but HMG-CoA lyase deficiency also causes the}
\textbf{accumulation of intermediates of the leucine catabolic pathway}
\item during fasting, the lack of KB leads to excessive glucose
consumption and hypoglycaemia
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:org23c29dd}
\begin{itemize}
\item HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) and HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL) deficiencies are
AR
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orge4ebe14}
\begin{itemize}
\item critical sample is important
\item if the plasma free fatty acid concentration is raised with an
inappropriately small rise in total KB it implies a defect of
ketogenesis or fatty acid oxidation 
\begin{itemize}
\item plasma FFA/total KB >2.5
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item HMG-CoA Synthase Deficiency
\label{sec:org8a1f511}
\begin{itemize}
\item during decompensation, urine contains saturated, unsaturated and
3-hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and other
metabolites, of which 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone is the most
specific
\item plasma acylcarnitines are normal when patients are well
\begin{itemize}
\item raised during illness
\end{itemize}
\item diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis
\end{itemize}

\item HMG-CoA Lyase Deficiency
\label{sec:orgace3c78}
\begin{itemize}
\item even when healthy, patients excrete increased quantities of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-hydroxyisovaleric, 3-methyl-glutaconic
and 3-methylglutaric acids
\item 3-methyl-crotonylglycine may also be present
\item blood acylcarnitine analysis shows raised
3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5OH)
\item diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis or measuring HMG-CoA
lyase activity in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:org4a502f6}
\begin{itemize}
\item avoid fasting and maintain  high carbohydrate intake during any
metabolic stress, such as infections
\item IV glucose is required if no oral intake or vomiting
\item IV sodium bicarbonate may be needed if there is severe acidosis in
HMG-CoA lyase deficiency
\item moderate protein restriction is usually recommended in HMG-CoA
lyase deficiency because of its role in leucine catabolism
\item HMG-CoA synthase deficiency has a good prognosis
\item HMG-CoA lyase deficiency have more encephalopathy as children or adults
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ketolysis Defects}
\label{sec:org537dce1}
\begin{itemize}
\item ketone body utilisation is catalysed by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT)
\item mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (T2)
\end{enumerate}
\item deficiencies of SCOT, T2 or MCT1 present with episodes of ketoacidosis
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:orgde938ef}
\begin{itemize}
\item patients present with episodes of severe ketoacidosis in early childhood
\item few patients have seizures or cardiomegaly at the time of presentation
\item patients are healthy between episodes, with normal blood pH
\item decompensation triggered by fasting or an infection with poor
feeding and vomiting
\item blood glucose, lactate and ammonia concentrations are usually normal
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:org55bf307}
\begin{itemize}
\item KB utilisation occurs in extrahepatic mitochondria, starting with
the transfer of coenzyme A from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate,
catalysed by SCOT
\item this forms acetoacetyl-CoA, which is converted to acetyl-CoA by T2
\item second reaction can also be catalysed to some extent by
medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (T1)
\begin{itemize}
\item may explain why T2 deficient patients do not have permanent
ketosis
\end{itemize}
\item SCOT is not expressed in liver and has no role other than
ketolysis
\item T2 is expressed in liver, involved in ketogenesis and ketolysis
\item patients with T2 deficiency present with ketoacidosis
\begin{itemize}
\item T2 more crucial in ketolysis than in ketogenesis
\end{itemize}
\item T2 also cleaves 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA in the isoleucine
degradation pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item T2 deficiency \(\to\) \(\uparrow\) isoleucine-derived acyl-CoA esters
\item these may be responsible for neurodevelopmental abnormalities
\end{itemize}
\item ketoacidosis in patients with MCT1 deficiency \(\to\) transporters are
facilitate rapid entry of KB at times of stress
\item MCT1 transporters are important for lactate transport
\begin{itemize}
\item expressed in the brain, particularly on oligodendroglia
\end{itemize}
\item learning difficulties in MCT1 deficient patients may be due to the
absence of MCT1 in the brain
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:orga90f92a}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR - SCOT (OXCT1), T2 (ACAT1) and MCT1 (SLC16A1)
\item heterozygous SLC16A1 and OXCT1 mutations have, however, been found
in several patients investigated for ketoacidosis, suggesting that
they can cause problems if subjects are exposed to sufficient stress

\item heterozygous SLC16A1 mutations can also cause hyperinsulinism
\begin{itemize}
\item these patients have promoter mutations that prevent the normal
silencing of MCT1 expression in pancreatic \(\beta\)-cells
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:orgb45d5f5}
\begin{enumerate}
\item SCOT \& MCT1 Deficiencies
\label{sec:orgd2869aa}
\begin{itemize}
\item should be considered in a number of patients because ketoacidosis is relatively common
\item a plasma free fatty acid:
\begin{itemize}
\item plasma FFA/total KB <0.3 suggests a defect of ketolysis
\end{itemize}
\item urine organic acids show \(\uparrow\) KB but no specific abnormalities
\item patients with severe SCOT deficiency have persistent ketonuria in
the fed state, but patients with a mild mutation do not
\item diagnoses are now usually made by mutation analysis
\end{itemize}
\item T2 Deficiency
\label{sec:org77a1c9b}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) urine 2-methylacetoacetate, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid
and tiglylglycine
\begin{itemize}
\item 2-methylacetoacetate is unstable
\end{itemize}
\item patient with mild mutations may only show abnormalities when they
are stressed (e.g isoleucine load)
\item 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causes a
similar pattern of organic acids but 2-methyacetoacetate is not excreted
\item diagnosis must be confirmed by mutation analysis or enzyme assay in fibroblasts
\begin{itemize}
\item Assays are complicated by the presence of other thiolases that act
on acetoacetyl-CoA
\end{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine and
tiglylcarnitine on plasma acylcarnitine
\begin{itemize}
\item may be normal with mild mutations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Treatment
\label{sec:orgb52c9fc}
\begin{itemize}
\item same as ketogenesis defects above
\item T2 involved in isoleucine met, \(\therefore\) \(\downarrow\) protein
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Creatine Deficiency}
\label{sec:org7c1133f}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orga6e931b}
\begin{itemize}
\item creatine is synthesized by two enzymatic reactions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) catalyses the
transfer of an amidino group from arginine to glycine, yielding
guanidinoacetate
\item guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) catalyses the
methylation of the amidino group in the guanidino-acetate
molecule, yielding creatine
\end{enumerate}

\item creatine synthesis occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in the kidney
and in the pancreas, which have high AGAT activity, and in the
liver, which has high GAMT activity

\item from these organs of synthesis, creatine is transported via the
bloodstream to the organs of utilization, mainly muscle and brain
\begin{itemize}
\item taken up by a sodium and chloride dependent creatine transporter
(CRTR)
\end{itemize}

\item most brain creatine is transported from the blood via CRTR expressed
at blood-brain barrier
\item a minor proportion is synthesized in the brain

\item part of intracellular creatine is reversibly converted into the
high-energy compound creatine-phosphate, by creatine kinase (CK)

\item three cytosolic isoforms of CK (brain type BB-CK, muscle type MM-CK
and the MB-CK heterodimer), and two mitochondrial isoforms exist

\item creatine and creatine-phosphate are non-enzymatically converted into
creatinine, with a constant daily turnover of 1.5\% of body
creatine

\item creatinine is mainly excreted in urine and its daily excretion is
directly proportional to total body creatine, and in particular to
muscle mass
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Creatine Deficiency Syndromes}
\label{sec:org0e34915}
\begin{itemize}
\item creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) are a group of inborn errors of:
\item creatine synthesis
\begin{itemize}
\item arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency
\item guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item creatine transport
\begin{itemize}
\item X-linked creatine transporter CRTR deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item global developmental delay/ intellectual disability along with
various neurological manifestations

\item secondary changes in creatine metabolism have been described in
disorders affecting arginine and ornithine metabolism including:
\begin{itemize}
\item ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) deficiency
\item urea cycle defects
\item hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome
\item \(\Delta\)1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) deficiency
\item methylcobalamin synthesis defects
\item mitochondrial disease
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clinical Presentation
\label{sec:org67dada5}
\begin{itemize}
\item global developmental delay (GDD) /intellectual disability (ID) with
prominent speech delay
\item GDD or ID ranges from mild to severe and is characteristically
associated with challenging (hyperactive, autistic) behaviours
\item distinguishing symptoms:
\begin{description}
\item[{AGAT}] myopathy
\item[{GAMT}] movement disorders and basal ganglia changes are
additional features
\item[{GAMT \& CRTR}] epilepsy
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\item Metabolic Derangement
\label{sec:orgdb1dc77}
\begin{itemize}
\item cerebral creatine deficiency is caused by reduced synthesis of
creatine in AGAT and GAMT deficiency or by impaired uptake into the
brain in CRTR deficiency
\item low intracellular creatine and creatine-phosphate result in reduced
production of creatinine
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) \low urine and plasma creatinine
\end{itemize}
\item guanidinoacetate is neurotoxic \(\to\) CNS
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) AGAT deficiency
\item \(\uparrow\) GAMT deficiency
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Genetics
\label{sec:orgace4906}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR, AGAT (GATM) and GAMT (GAMT)
\item X-linked, CRTC (SLC6A8)
\end{itemize}
\item Diagnostic Tests
\label{sec:org0ab40fe}
\begin{itemize}
\item MRS to screen for cerebral creatine deficiency
\item urine guanidinoacetate, creatine and creatinine is an important
screening test for all CDS
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) AGAT, \(\le\) 10\% of LLN
\item \(\uparrow\) GAMT , 10x normal
\end{itemize}
\item CSF guanidinoacetate
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) GAMT, 100x normal
\end{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) urine creatinine/creatine in CRTR
