* Introduction
- creatine is synthesized by two enzymatic reactions:
  1) arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) catalyses the
     transfer of an amidino group from arginine to glycine, yielding
     guanidinoacetate
  2) guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) catalyses the
     methylation of the amidino group in the guanidino-acetate
     molecule, yielding creatine

- creatine synthesis occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in the kidney
  and in the pancreas, which have high AGAT activity, and in the
  liver, which has high GAMT activity

- from these organs of synthesis, creatine is transported via the
  bloodstream to the organs of utilization, mainly muscle and brain
  - taken up by a sodium and chloride dependent creatine transporter
    (CRTR)

- most brain creatine is transported from the blood via CRTR expressed
  at blood-brain barrier
- a minor proportion is synthesized in the brain

- part of intracellular creatine is reversibly converted into the
  high-energy compound creatine-phosphate, by creatine kinase (CK)

- three cytosolic isoforms of CK (brain type BB-CK, muscle type MM-CK
  and the MB-CK heterodimer), and two mitochondrial isoforms exist

- creatine and creatine-phosphate are non-enzymatically converted into
  creatinine, with a constant daily turnover of 1.5% of body
  creatine

- creatinine is mainly excreted in urine and its daily excretion is
  directly proportional to total body creatine, and in particular to
  muscle mass

* Creatine Deficiency Syndromes
- creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) are a group of inborn errors of:
- creatine synthesis
  - arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency
  - guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency
- creatine transport
  - X-linked creatine transporter CRTR deficiency
- global developmental delay/ intellectual disability along with
  various neurological manifestations

- secondary changes in creatine metabolism have been described in
  disorders affecting arginine and ornithine metabolism including:
  - ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) deficiency
  - urea cycle defects
  - hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome
  - \Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) deficiency
  - methylcobalamin synthesis defects
  - mitochondrial disease

** Clinical Presentation
- global developmental delay (GDD) /intellectual disability (ID) with
  prominent speech delay
- GDD or ID ranges from mild to severe and is characteristically
  associated with challenging (hyperactive, autistic) behaviours
- distinguishing symptoms:
  - AGAT :: myopathy
  - GAMT :: movement disorders and basal ganglia changes are
            additional features
  - GAMT & CRTR :: epilepsy

** Metabolic Derangement
- cerebral creatine deficiency is caused by reduced synthesis of
  creatine in AGAT and GAMT deficiency or by impaired uptake into the
  brain in CRTR deficiency
- low intracellular creatine and creatine-phosphate result in reduced
  production of creatinine
  - \therefore \low urine and plasma creatinine
- guanidinoacetate is neurotoxic \to CNS
  - \downarrow AGAT deficiency
  - \uparrow GAMT deficiency

** Genetics
- AR, AGAT (GATM) and GAMT (GAMT)
- X-linked, CRTC (SLC6A8)
** Diagnostic Tests
- MRS to screen for cerebral creatine deficiency
- urine guanidinoacetate, creatine and creatinine is an important
  screening test for all CDS
  - \downarrow AGAT, \le 10% of LLN
  - \uparrow GAMT , 10x normal
- CSF guanidinoacetate
  - \uparrow GAMT, 100x normal
- \uparrow urine creatinine/creatine in CRTR

|      | GAA        | creatine/creatinine |
|------+------------+---------------------|
| AGAT | \downarrow | n/\downarrow        |
| GAMT | \uparrow   | \downarrow          |
| CRTR | n          | \uparrow            |

** Treatment
- normal neurodevelopmental outcome has been reported in early treated
  patients with creatine synthesis defects
- AGAT and GAMT treated with creatine monohydrate
- in GAMT deficiency, reduction of guanidinoacetate is achieved by
  ornithine supplementation \pm dietary arginine restriction
- CRTC no treatment
- in CRTR deficiency, creatine, arginine and glycine supplementation
  does not significantly improve outcome, although partial clinical
  improvement has been reported in single patients
