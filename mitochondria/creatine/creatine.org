* Introduction

- Creatine is synthesized by two enzymatic reactions:
  1) L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, GATM) catalyses the
     transfer of an amidino group from arginine to glycine, yielding
     guanidinoacetate
  2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine:N-guanidinoacetatemethyltransferase
     (GAMT, GAMT) catalyses the methylation of the amidino group in
     the guanidino-acetate molecule, yielding creatine.

- Creatine synthesis occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in the kidney
  and in the pancreas, which have high AGAT activity, and in the
  liver, which has high GAMT activity.

- From these organs of synthesis, creatine is transported via the
  bloodstream to the organs of utilization (mainly muscle and brain)
  - where both the endogenously synthetized creatine as well as the
    creatine derived from dietary sources is taken up by a sodium and
    chloride dependent creatine transporter (CRTR,SLC6A8).

- The major proportion of brain creatine is taken up from the blood
  via CRTR expressed at blood-brain barrier.

- A minor proportion is synthesized in the brain.

- Part of intracellular creatine is reversibly converted into the
  high-energy compound creatine-phosphate, by the action of creatine
  kinase (CK).

- Three cytosolic isoforms of CK (brain type BB-CK, muscle type MM-CK
  and the MB-CK heterodimer), and two mitochondrial isoforms exist.

- Creatine and creatine-phosphate are non-enzymatically converted into
  creatinine, with a constant daily turnover of 1.5% of body
  creatine.

- Creatinine is mainly excreted in urine and its daily excretion is
  directly proportional to total body creatine, and in particular to
  muscle mass

* Creatine Deficiency Syndromes
- Creatine deficiency syndromes (CDS) are a group of inborn errors of
  creatine synthesis:
  - arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency
  - guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency
- and transport:
  - X-linked creatine transporter CRTR deficiency
- CDS typically present with global developmental delay/ intellectual
  disability along with various neurological
  manifestations.
- Diagnostic markers include:
- cerebral creatine deficiency
- \uparrow guanidinoacetate in GAMT
- \downarrow guanidinoacetate in AGAT
- \uparrow urinary creatine/creatinine in CRTR deficiency.
- Oral supplementation of creatine leads to near complete restoration
  of cerebral creatine in creatine synthesis defects
- In GAMT deficiency, reduction of guanidinoacetate is achieved by
  ornithine supplementation \pm dietary arginine restriction.
- In CRTR deficiency, creatine, arginine and glycine supplementation
  does not significantly improve outcome, although partial clinical
  improvement has been reported in single patients.
- Normal neurodevelopmental outcome has been reported in early treated
  patients with creatine synthesis defects.
- Secondary changes in creatine metabolism have been described in
  disorders affecting arginine and ornithine metabolism including:
  - ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) deficiency
  - urea cycle defects
  - hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome
  - \delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency
  - defects of methylcobalamin synthesis
  - mitochondrial disease

** Clinical Presentation
- global developmental delay (GDD) /intellectual disability (ID) with
  prominent speech delay.
- GDD or ID ranges from mild to severe and is characteristically
  associated with challenging (hyperactive, autistic) behaviours.
- Movement disorders and basal ganglia changes are additional features
  in GAMT deficiency.
- Myopathy is an additional feature of AGAT deficiency.
- Epilepsy occurs in GAMT and CRTR deficiencies.

** Metabolic Derangement
- Cerebral  creatine  deficiency is  caused  by  reduced synthesis  of
  creatine in AGAT and GAMT deficiency  or by impaired uptake into the
  brain in CRTR deficiency.
- Low intracellular creatine and creatine-phosphate result in reduced
  production of creatinine
  - \therefore \low urine and plasma creatinine
- Guanidinoacetate is neurotoxic \to CNS
  - \downarrow AGAT deficiency
  - \uparrow GAMT deficiency
  - 
** Genetics
- AR, AGAT (GATM) and GAMT (GAMT)
- X-linked, CRTC (SLC6A8)
** Diagnostic Tests
- MRS to screen for cerebral creatine deficiency
- urine guanidinoacetate, creatine and creatinine is an important
  screening test for all CDS
  - \downarrow AGAT, \le 10% of LLN
  - \uparrow GAMT , 10x normal
- CSF guanidinoacetate
  - \uparrow GAMT, 100x normal
- \uparrow urine creatinine/creatine in CRTR 
  - 
** Treatment
- AGAT and GAMT treated wtih creatine monohydrate
- CRTC no treatment
