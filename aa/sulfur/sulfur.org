* Introduction
- methionine is converted by two methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT
  I/III and MATII) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
- methyl group of SAM is used in numerous methylation reactions,
  yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
- excess SAM is removed from the cycle by glycine N-methyltransferas (GNMT)
- SAH is cleaved by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) to
  homocysteine and adenosine, which is phosphorylated by adenosine
  kinase (ADK)
- homocysteine has two metabolic pathways:
  1. remethylated back to methionine by the remethylation pathway or
     using betaine as a methyl-group donor, in patients treated with
     this drug
  2. irreversibly metabolized to sulfate
     by the transsulfuration pathway
     - homocysteine and serine are condensed by cystathionine \beta-Synthase (CBS) to cystathionine
     - cystathionine is cleaved by cystathionine \gamma-lyase (CTH) to
       form cysteine and \alpha-ketobutyrate
- CTH can use cysteine and/or homocysteine to synthesize hydrogen
  sulfide
- cysteine can be further converted:
  - in a series of reactions to taurine or
  - via the mitochondrial enzymes, AST and 3-mercaptopyruvate
    sulfurtransferase (MPST), to pyruvate and hydrogen sulfide
- mitochondrial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and of cysteine involves
  several steps yielding thiosulfate , sulfite and finally sulfate
- inorganic sulfur released from cysteine residues \to mitochondrial
  iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster cofactors
- availability of cysteine in the neonatal period is limited because
  its endogenous synthesis from methionine by the transsulfuration
  pathway is markedly attenuated
- activity of the rate limiting enzyme in the pathway, cystathionase ,
  is very low at birth and increases slowly during the first few months of life
  - cysteine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid, at
    least in preterm infants

- disorders in sulfur amino acid metabolism exhibit:
  - altered methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, sarcosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine,
    total homocysteine or cystathionine concentrations in blood
  - adenosine or thiosulfate excretion in urine


- CBS deficiency – classical homocystinuria – is the most common
  disease in this group
  - severity varies from
    - multisystemic childhood condition with lens dislocation,
      osteoporosis, marfanoid features, central nervous system and
      vascular complications
    - isolated thromboembolic disease in adults.
- CTH deficiency appears to be a biochemical trait with no major
  clinical sequelae
- Disorders of cysteine and hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathway include:
  - ethylmalonic encephalopathy
  - isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
  - combined sulfite oxidase deficiency
    - due to impaired molybdenum cofactor synthesis
- these are severe disorders with early-onset seizures and other
  neurological complications
  - other signs include orthostatic acrocyanosis, lens dislocation or
    urolithiasis;
- only molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A can be treated
  successfully, with a synthetic cofactor

* Methionine S-Adenosyltransferase Deficiency
- Mudd’s Disease
** Clinical presentation
- most patients detected by NBS for CBS deficiency using methionine as a marker
- neurological abnormalities occur in most patients with plasma methionine \gt 800 μmol/l
  - rare in subjects with lower levels
** Metabolic derangement
- Methionine S-adenosyltransferase converts methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) using ATP
- MAT exists in 3 forms
- MAT I and III are encoded by the same gene
  - tetrameric and dimeric forms, respectively
  - liver specific
- MAT II is encoded by a different gene
  - converts methionine to SAM outside the liver
  - explains why MAT I/III deficiency is relatively benign
** Genetics
- AR, MAT1A
- some mutation are AD
** Diagnostic Tests
- plasma methionine 50 to \gt 2000 umol/L
- other causes of hypermethioninemia:
  - liver disease
  - prematurity 
  - excessive intake of methionine
  - less often, CBS, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and ADK deficiencies
    - CBS has \Uparrow homocysteine
** Treatment
- methionine restricted diet if met \gt 800 umol/L

* Cystathionine \beta-Synthase Deficiency
** Clinical presentation
- wide spectrum of severity and age at presentation
- some asymptomatic into adulthood
- others have severe multisystem disease
- clinical features predominantly involve four organ systems:
  - eye :: lens dislocation
  - skeleton :: excessive growth - Marfanoid but stiff
  - brain :: learning disabilities
  - vascular :: thromboembolism
** Metabolic derangement
- CBS is a cytosolic tetrameric enzyme
- expressed predominantly in liver, pancreas, kidney and brain
- activity can alsobe determined in cultured fibroblasts and in plasma
  due to its release from the liver
- catalytic domain binds heme,the cofactor PLP and substrates
- regulatory domain binds the allosteric activator SAM
- pathophysiology is not fully understood
  - \uparrow SAH impairs methylation reaction
  - \uparrow homocysteine \to ER stress, vascular disease
  - enhanced remethylation methionine
  - depletion of cystathionine and cysteine \to apoptosis, oxidative stress, \delta protein structure.

** Genetics
- AR, CBS

** Diagnostic tests
- plasma total homocysteine (tHcy)
  - \gt 100 umol/L
  - plasma should be separated from whole blood within one hour of venepuncture
- measurement of free homocystine is not recommended
  - low sensitivity
  - complicated pre-analytical requirements
- to avoid misdiagnosis in pyridoxine responsive patients
  - pyridoxine supplements including multivitamins should be avoided
    for at least 2 weeks prior to testing
- diagnosis very likely if the plasma methionine is high or borderline
  high and supported by:
  - \downarrow to low-normal plasma cystathionine
  - \uparrow methionine:cystathionine
- can be con firmed by enzyme assay in cultured fibroblasts or plasma,
  and/or mutation analysis of the CBS gene

** Treatment 
- pyridoxine, betaine and a methionine-restricted diet

* Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency
** Clinical presentation
- usually present soon after birth with poor feeding,hypotonia,
  exaggerated startle reactions and intractable seizures, resembling
  hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
  - \to multicystic leukoencephalopathy with microcephaly
- dislocation of the ocular lens occurs during infancy and xanthine
  renal stones can develop later

** Metabolic derangement
- molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis involves three steps:
  - MoCo deficiency type A :: affects the conversion of GTP to cyclic
       pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP)
  - MoCo deficiency type B ::  cannot convert cPMP to molybdopterin
  - MoCo deficiency type C :: affects gephyrin, which catalyses
       adenylation of molybdopterin and insertion of molybdenum to
       form the cofactor
- molybdenum cofactor is needed for:
  - sulfite oxidase
  - aldehyde oxidase
  - mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC)
  - xanthine dehydrogenase
- xanthine dehydrogenase deficiency causes raised xanthine and low
  urate concentrations
- sulfite accumulation is responsible for the neurotoxicity and lens
  dislocation

** Genetics
- AR
- Type A, MOCS1, most common
- Type B, MOCS2
- Type C, GPHN, rare

** Diagnostic tests
- plasma urate concentration is initially normal but decreases after a
  few days and remains low (<0.06 mmol/L)
- \uparrow urine xanthine
- sulfite can be detected in fresh urine using dipsticks but false
  positive and negative results occur
- \uparrow urine or blood s-sulfocysteine is a more reliable indicator
- s-sulfocysteine accumulation \to inhibition of antiquitin
  - secondary elevation of pipecolic acid
- \uparrow plasma taurine and thiosulfate
- \downarrow plasma total cysteine and tHcy
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis

** Treatment
- without treatment, patients have profound handicap and die early
- successful treatment of Type A with daily intravenous infusions of
  cPMP
- no treatment for Types B & C

* Isolated Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency
** Clinical presentation
- resembles MoCo deficiency
** Metabolic derangement
- sulfite derived from cysteine is normally oxidised to form
  sulfate
- in sulfite oxidase deficiency, accumulating sulfite damages the brain
  - partly due to the production of sulfocysteine, which
    mediates excitotoxicity
- sulfite probably causes lens dislocation by disrupting cystine
  cross-linkages in the suspensory ligament

** Genetics
- AR, SUOX

** Diagnostic tests
- sulfite can be detected in fresh urine using dipsticks
  - not reliable
- \uparrow urine or blood s-sulfocysteine
- \uparrow plasma taurine
- \downarrow plasma total cysteine and tHcy
- normal urate and xanthine
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis

** Treatment
- prognosis for neonatal-onset cases is poor
- diet low in cysteine and methionine may help patients with a mild
  form

* Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy
** Clinical presentation
- progressive multisystem disease
- presents in the first months of life with hypotonia, chronic
  diarrhoea, orthostatic acrocyanosis, recurrent petechial rash and
  bruising (with normal platelets)
- developmental regression, microcephaly, seizures, episodes of coma,
  poor growth and hyperlactataemia
- most die in early childhood, though some have a milder course

** Metabolic derangement
- deficiency of a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase necessary for the
  detoxification of sulfide
- hydrogen sulfide (\ce{H2S}) is synthesized endogenously by CBS, CTH
  and 3-mercaptosulfurtransferase
  - also formed by bacterial anaerobes in the large intestine
- in EE accumulating \ce{H2S} inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and
  short-chain fatty acid oxidation
  - results in ethylmalonic aciduria , and raised C4- and C5-acylcarnitines in blood
- \ce{H2S} also has vasoactive and vasotoxic effects
  - damage to small blood vessels causes bleeding into the
    skin
  - production of \ce{H2S} by gut bacteria causes the severe, persistent diarrhea

** Genetics
- AR, ETHE1, rare

** Diagnostic tests
- \uparrow urine ethylmalonic acid
- \uparrow urine C4- and C5-acylglycines
- \uparrow plasma C4- and C5-acylcarnitines
- \Uparrow urine thiosulfate is also markedly elevated
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis

** Treatment 
- metronidazole to reduce bacterial \ce{H2S} production
- N-acetylcysteine a precursor of glutathione, which can accept the sulfur atom of \ce{H2S}
  - leads to some clinical and biochemical improvement the prognosis remains poor
- Liver transplant
