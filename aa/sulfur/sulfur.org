- methionine is converted by two methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT
  I/III and MATII) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
- the methyl group of SAM is used in numerous methylation reactions,
  yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
- excess SAM is removed from the cycle by glycine N-methyltransferas (GNMT)
- SAH is cleaved by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) to
  homocysteine and adenosine, which is phosphorylated by adenosine
  kinase (ADK)
- homocysteine has two metabolic pathways (Figure [[fig:sulfur2]]):
  1. remethylated back to methionine by the *remethylation pathway* or
     using betaine as a methyl-group donor, in patients treated with
     this drug
  2. irreversibly metabolized to sulfate
     by the *transsulfuration pathway*
     - homocysteine and serine are condensed by cystathionine
       \beta-synthase (CBS) to cystathionine
     - cystathionine is cleaved by cystathionine \gamma-lyase (CTH, AKA cystathionase) to
       form cysteine and \alpha-ketobutyrate
- CTH can use cysteine and/or homocysteine to synthesize hydrogen
  sulfide
- cysteine can be further converted:
  - in a series of reactions to taurine
  - via the mitochondrial enzymes, AST and 3-mercaptopyruvate
    sulfurtransferase (MPST), to pyruvate and hydrogen sulfide
- mitochondrial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (\ce{H2S}) and of cysteine involves
  several steps yielding thiosulfate (\ce{S2O3^2-}), sulfite
  (\ce{SO3^2-}) and finally sulfate (\ce{SO4-})
- inorganic sulfur released from cysteine residues \to mitochondrial
  iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster cofactors
- availability of cysteine in the neonatal period is limited because
  its endogenous synthesis from methionine by the transsulfuration
  pathway is markedly attenuated
- activity of the rate limiting enzyme in the pathway cytathione
  \gamma-lyase is very low at birth and increases slowly during the
  first few months of life
  - cysteine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid, at
    least in preterm infants

- disorders in sulfur amino acid metabolism exhibit:
  - altered methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, sarcosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine,
    total homocysteine or cystathionine concentrations in blood
  - adenosine or thiosulfate excretion in urine


- CBS deficiency (AKA classical homocystinuria) is the most common
  disease in this group
- CTH deficiency appears to be a biochemical trait with no major
  clinical sequelae
- disorders of cysteine and hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathway include:
  - ethylmalonic encephalopathy
  - isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
  - combined sulfite oxidase deficiency
    - due to impaired molybdenum cofactor synthesis
- these are severe disorders with early-onset seizures and other
  neurological complications
  - other signs include orthostatic acrocyanosis, lens dislocation or
    urolithiasis
- only molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A can be treated
  successfully, with a synthetic cofactor
- for methionine synthase see Cobalamin and Folate

* Methionine S-Adenosyltransferase Deficiency
- Mudd’s Disease
** Clinical Presentation
- most patients detected by NBS for CBS deficiency using methionine as a marker
- neurological abnormalities occur in most patients with plasma methionine \gt 800 μmol/l
  - rare in subjects with lower levels
** Metabolic Derangement
- methionine S-adenosyltransferase (MAT) converts methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) using ATP
- MAT exists in 3 forms
- MAT I and III tetrameric and dimeric forms encoded MAT1A 
  - liver specific
- MAT II is encoded by a different gene
  - converts methionine to SAM outside the liver
  - explains why MAT I/III deficiency is relatively benign
** Genetics
- AR MAT1A 
- some mutation are AD
** Diagnostic Tests
- plasma methionine 50 to \gt 2000 umol/L
- other causes of hypermethioninemia:
  - liver disease
  - prematurity 
  - excessive intake of methionine
  - less often, CBS, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and ADK deficiencies
    - CBS has \Uparrow homocysteine
** Treatment
- methionine restricted diet if met \gt 800 umol/L

* Cystathionine \beta-Synthase Deficiency
- AKA Homocystinuria
** Clinical Presentation
- wide spectrum of severity and age at presentation
- severity varies from
  - multisystemic childhood condition with lens dislocation,
    osteoporosis, marfanoid features, central nervous system and
    vascular complications
  - isolated thromboembolic disease in adults
- clinical features predominantly involve four organ systems:
  - eye :: lens dislocation
  - skeleton :: excessive growth - marfanoid but stiff
  - brain :: learning disabilities
  - vascular :: thromboembolism
** Metabolic Derangement
- CBS is a cytosolic tetrameric enzyme

\ce{homocysteine ->[CBS] cystathionine}

- expressed predominantly in liver, pancreas, kidney and brain
  - activity can also be determined in cultured fibroblasts and in plasma
    due to its release from the liver
- catalytic domain binds heme, PLP and substrates
- regulatory domain binds the allosteric activator SAM
- pathophysiology is not fully understood
  - \uparrow SAH impairs methylation reaction
  - \uparrow homocysteine \to ER stress, vascular disease
  - enhanced remethylation \to \uparrow methionine
  - depletion of cystathionine and cysteine \to apoptosis, oxidative
    stress, \Delta protein structure.

** Genetics
- AR CBS

** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow plasma total homocysteine (tHcy)
  - \gt 150 umol/L
- \uparrow plasma methionine
- measurement of free homocystine is not recommended
  - low sensitivity
  - complicated pre-analytical requirements
- to avoid misdiagnosis in pyridoxine responsive patients
  - pyridoxine supplements including multivitamins should be avoided
    for at least 2 weeks prior to testing
- diagnosis very likely if the plasma methionine is high or borderline
  high and supported by:
  - \downarrow to low-normal plasma cystathionine
  - \uparrow methionine:cystathionine
- can be confirmed by enzyme assay in cultured fibroblasts or plasma,
  and/or mutation analysis of the CBS gene

** Treatment 
- pyridoxine, betaine and a methionine-restricted diet

* Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- usually present soon after birth with poor feeding, hypotonia,
  exaggerated startle reactions and intractable seizures, resembling
  hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
  - \to multicystic leukoencephalopathy with microcephaly
- dislocation of the ocular lens occurs during infancy and xanthine
  renal stones can develop later

** Metabolic Derangement
- molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) is a molybdenum containing ptern,
  synthesis involves three steps:
  - MoCo deficiency type A :: affects the conversion of GTP to cyclic
       pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP)
  - MoCo deficiency type B ::  cannot convert cPMP to molybdopterin
  - MoCo deficiency type C :: affects gephyrin, which catalyses
       adenylation of molybdopterin and insertion of molybdenum to
       form the cofactor
- molybdenum cofactor is needed for:
  - sulfite oxidase, final step in transsulfuration pathway
  - aldehyde oxidase
  - mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC)
  - xanthine dehydrogenase
- xanthine dehydrogenase deficiency causes raised xanthine and low
  urate concentrations
- sulfite accumulation is responsible for the neurotoxicity and lens
  dislocation

** Genetics
- AR
- Type A :: MOCS1 most common
- Type B :: MOCS2
- Type C :: GPHN rare

** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow plasma urate concentration
  - initially normal but decreases after a few days and remains low
- \uparrow urine xanthine
- sulfite (SO_3^{2-}) can be detected in fresh urine using dipsticks but false
  positive and negative results occur
- \uparrow urine or blood S-sulfocysteine is a more reliable indicator

\ce{SO3^2- + cystine ->[unknown] S-sulfocysteine}

  - S-sulfocysteine accumulation \to inhibition of antiquitin
    - secondary elevation of pipecolic acid
- \uparrow plasma taurine and thiosulfate
- \downarrow plasma total cysteine and tHcy
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis

** Treatment
- without treatment, patients have profound handicap and die early
- successful treatment of Type A with daily intravenous infusions of
  cPMP
- no treatment for Types B & C

* Isolated Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- resembles MoCo deficiency
** Metabolic Derangement
- in *sulfite oxidase* deficiency accumulating sulfite damages the
  brain
  - partly due to the production of sulfocysteine, which
    mediates excitotoxicity

\ce{SO3^2- + cystine ->[unknown] S-sulfocysteine}

- sulfite derived from cysteine is normally oxidised to form
  sulfate
- sulfite probably causes lens dislocation by disrupting cystine
  cross-linkages 
** Genetics
- AR SUOX

** Diagnostic Tests
- sulfite can be detected in fresh urine using dipsticks
  - not reliable
- \uparrow urine or blood S-sulfocysteine
  - S-sulfocysteine accumulation \to inhibition of antiquitin
    - secondary elevation of pipecolic acid
- \uparrow plasma taurine
- \downarrow plasma total cysteine and tHcy
- normal urate and xanthine
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis

** Treatment
- prognosis for neonatal-onset cases is poor
- diet low in cysteine and methionine may help patients with a mild
  form

* Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy
** Clinical Presentation
- progressive multisystem disease
- presents in the first months of life with hypotonia, chronic
  diarrhoea, orthostatic acrocyanosis, recurrent petechial rash and
  bruising (with normal platelets)
- developmental regression, microcephaly, seizures, episodes of coma,
  poor growth and hyperlactataemia
- most die in early childhood, though some have a milder course

** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of a *mitochondrial persulfide dioxygenase* necessary for
  the detoxification of hydrogen sulfide (\ce{H2S})
- \ce{H2S} is synthesized endogenously by CBS, CTH and
  3-mercaptosulfur transferase
  - also formed by bacterial anaerobes in the large intestine
- in EE accumulating \ce{H2S} inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and
  short-chain fatty acid oxidation
  - results in ethylmalonic aciduria, and raised butyrl-carnitine (C4)
    and isovaleryl-carnintine (C5) in blood
- \ce{H2S} also has vasoactive and vasotoxic effects
  - damage to small blood vessels causes bleeding into the
    skin
  - production of \ce{H2S} by gut bacteria causes the severe, persistent diarrhea

** Genetics
- AR ETHE1 rare
** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow lactate
- \uparrow urine ethylmalonic and methylsuccinic
- \uparrow urine butyrlglycine isovalerylglycine
- \uparrow plasma butyrl-carnitine (C4) and isovaleryl-carnintine (C5)
- \Uparrow urine thiosulfate is also markedly elevated
- diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis

** Treatment 
- metronidazole to reduce bacterial \ce{H2S} production
- N-acetylcysteine a precursor of glutathione, which can accept the sulfur atom of \ce{H2S}
  - leads to some clinical and biochemical improvement the prognosis remains poor
- liver transplant
