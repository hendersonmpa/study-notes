* Introduction
- methionine is converted by two methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT
  I/III and MATII) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
- methyl group of SAM is used in numerous methylation reactions,
  yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
- excess SAM is removed from the cycle by glycine N-methyltransferas (GNMT)
- SAH is cleaved by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) to
  homocysteine and adenosine, which is phosphorylated by adenosine
  kinase (ADK)
- homocysteine can be converted back to methionine by the
  remethylation pathway or using betaine as a methyl-group donor, in
  patients treated with this drug
- alternatively, homocysteine is irreversibly metabolized to sulfate
  by the transsulfuration pathway
  - homocysteine is condensed with serine to form cystathionine, which
    is subsequently cleaved to form cysteine and \alpha-ketobutyrate
  - these reactions are catalysed by cystathionine \beta-Synthase
    (CBS) and cystathionine \gamma-lyase (CTH) , respectively
- CTH can also use cysteine and/or homocysteine to synthesize
  hydrogen sulfide
- cysteine can be further converted in a series of reactions to
  taurine , or via the mitochondrial enzymes, AST and
  3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), to pyruvate and
  hydrogen sulfide
- mitochondrial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and of cysteine involves
  several steps yielding thiosulfate , sulfite and finally sulfate
- inorganic sulfur released from cysteine residues by a series of
  reactions is used in the formation of mitochondrial iron-sulfur
  (FeS) cluster cofactors
- availability of cysteine in the neonatal period is limited because
  its endogenous synthesis from methionine by the transsulfuration
  pathway is markedly attenuated
- activity of the rate limiting enzyme in the pathway, cystathionase ,
  is very low at birth and increases slowly during the first few months of life
  - for this reason, cysteine is considered a conditionally essential
    amino acid, at least in preterm infants

- disorders in sulfur amino acid metabolism exhibit:
  - altered methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, sarcosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine,
    total homocysteine or cystathionine concentrations in blood
  - adenosine or thiosulfate excretion in urine


- CBS deficiency – classical homocystinuria – is the commonest disease
  in this group
  - severity varies from
    - multisystemic childhood condition with lens dislocation,
      osteoporosis, marfanoid features, central nervous system and
      vascular complications
    - isolated thromboembolic disease in adults.
- CTH deficiency appears to be a biochemical trait with no major
  clinical sequelae
- Disorders of cysteine and hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathway include:
  - ethylmalonic encephalopathy
  - isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
  - combined sulfite oxidase deficiency
    - due to impaired molybdenum cofactor synthesis
- These are severe disorders with early-onset seizures and other
  neurological complications
  - other signs include orthostatic acrocyanosis, lens dislocation or
    urolithiasis;
- only molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A can be treated
  successfully, with a synthetic cofactor
