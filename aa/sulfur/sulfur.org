* Introduction
- methionine is converted by two methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT
  I/III and MATII) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
- methyl group of SAM is used in numerous methylation reactions,
  yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
- excess SAM is removed from the cycle by glycine N-methyltransferas (GNMT)
- SAH is cleaved by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) to
  homocysteine and adenosine, which is phosphorylated by adenosine
  kinase (ADK)
- homocysteine has two metabolic pathways:
  1. remethylated back to methionine by the remethylation pathway or
     using betaine as a methyl-group donor, in patients treated with
     this drug
  2. irreversibly metabolized to sulfate
     by the transsulfuration pathway
     - homocysteine and serine are condensed by cystathionine \beta-Synthase (CBS) to cystathionine
     - cystathionine is cleaved by cystathionine \gamma-lyase (CTH) to
       form cysteine and \alpha-ketobutyrate
- CTH can use cysteine and/or homocysteine to synthesize hydrogen
  sulfide
- cysteine can be further converted:
  - in a series of reactions to taurine or
  - via the mitochondrial enzymes, AST and 3-mercaptopyruvate
    sulfurtransferase (MPST), to pyruvate and hydrogen sulfide
- mitochondrial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and of cysteine involves
  several steps yielding thiosulfate , sulfite and finally sulfate
- inorganic sulfur released from cysteine residues \to mitochondrial
  iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster cofactors
- availability of cysteine in the neonatal period is limited because
  its endogenous synthesis from methionine by the transsulfuration
  pathway is markedly attenuated
- activity of the rate limiting enzyme in the pathway, cystathionase ,
  is very low at birth and increases slowly during the first few months of life
  - cysteine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid, at
    least in preterm infants

- disorders in sulfur amino acid metabolism exhibit:
  - altered methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, sarcosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine,
    total homocysteine or cystathionine concentrations in blood
  - adenosine or thiosulfate excretion in urine


- CBS deficiency – classical homocystinuria – is the most common
  disease in this group
  - severity varies from
    - multisystemic childhood condition with lens dislocation,
      osteoporosis, marfanoid features, central nervous system and
      vascular complications
    - isolated thromboembolic disease in adults.
- CTH deficiency appears to be a biochemical trait with no major
  clinical sequelae
- Disorders of cysteine and hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathway include:
  - ethylmalonic encephalopathy
  - isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
  - combined sulfite oxidase deficiency
    - due to impaired molybdenum cofactor synthesis
- these are severe disorders with early-onset seizures and other
  neurological complications
  - other signs include orthostatic acrocyanosis, lens dislocation or
    urolithiasis;
- only molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A can be treated
  successfully, with a synthetic cofactor

* Methionine S-Adenosyltransferase Deficiency
- Mudd’s Disease
** Clinical presentation
- most patients detected by NBS for CBS deficiency using methionine as a marker
- neurological abnormalities occur in most patients with plasma methionine \gt 800 μmol/l
  - rare in subjects with lower levels
** Metabolic derangement
- Methionine S-adenosyltransferase converts methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) using ATP
- MAT exists in 3 forms
- MAT I and III are encoded by the same gene
  - tetrameric and dimeric forms, respectively
  - liver specific
- MAT II is encoded by a different gene
  - converts methionine to SAM outside the liver
  - explains why MAT I/III deficiency is relatively benign
** Genetics
- AR, MAT1A
- some mutation are AD
** Diagnostic Tests
- plasma methionine 50 to \gt 2000 umol/L
- other causes of hypermethioninemia:
  - liver disease
  - prematurity 
  - excessive intake of methionine
  - less often, CBS, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and ADK deficiencies
    - CBS has \Uparrow homocysteine
** Treatment
- methionine restricted diet if met \gt 800 umol/L

* Cystathionine \beta-Synthase Deficiency
** Clinical presentation
- wide spectrum of severity and age at presentation
- some asymptomatic into adulthood
- others have severe multisystem disease
- clinical features predominantly involve four organ systems:
  - eye :: lens dislocation
  - skeleton :: excessive growth - Marfanoid but stiff
  - brain :: learning disabilities
  - vascular :: thromboembolism
** Metabolic derangement
- CBS is a cytosolic tetrameric enzyme
- expressed predominantly in liver, pancreas, kidney and brain
- activity can alsobe determined in cultured fibroblasts and in plasma
  due to its release from the liver
- catalytic domain binds heme,the cofactor PLP and substrates
- regulatory domain binds the allosteric activator SAM
- pathophysiology is not fully understood
  - \uparrow SAH impairs methylation reaction
  - \uparrow homocysteine \to ER stress, vascular disease
  - enhanced remethylation methionine
  - depletion of cystathionine and cysteine \to apoptosis, oxidative stress, \delta protein structure.

** Genetics
- AR, CBS

** Diagnostic tests
- plasma total homocysteine (tHcy)
  - \gt 100 umol/L
  - plasma should be separated from whole blood within one hour of venepuncture
- measurement of free homocystine is not recommended
  - low sensitivity
  - complicated pre-analytical requirements
- to avoid misdiagnosis in pyridoxine responsive patients
  - pyridoxine supplements including multivitamins should be avoided
    for at least 2 weeks prior to testing
- diagnosis very likely if the plasma methionine is high or borderline
  high and supported by:
  - \downarrow to low-normal plasma cystathionine
  - \uparrow methionine:cystathionine
- can be con firmed by enzyme assay in cultured fibroblasts or plasma,
  and/or mutation analysis of the CBS gene

** Treatment 
- pyridoxine, betaine and a methionine-restricted diet
