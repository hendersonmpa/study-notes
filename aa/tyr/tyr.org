* Introduction

- Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid derived from diet and hydroxylation of phenylalanine
- a precursor of DOPA, thyroxine and melanin
- glucogenic and ketogenic \to catabolism in liver cytosol \to fumarate and acetoacetate
- Tyr \to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate by cytosolic tyrosine aminotransferase
  - also in liver and other tissues by mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase
    - minor role under normal conditions
- penultimate intermediates maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate
  are reduced to succinylacetoacetate
  - decarboxylation to succinylacetone
  - succinylacetone is the most potent known inhibitor of the heme biosynthetic enzyme ALAD

- Five inherited disorders of tyrosine metabolism are known:
  - Tyrosinemia type I is characterised by progressive
    liver disease and renal tubular dysfunction with rickets
  - Tyrosinemia type II presents with keratitis and
    blistering lesions of the palms and soles and neurological
    complications
  - Tyrosinemia type III may be asymptomatic or associated with
    mental retardation
  - Hawkinsinuria may be asymptomatic or present with failure to
    thrive and metabolic acidosis in infancy
  - Alkaptonuria presents as adult with symptoms of osteoarthritis
- Other inborn errors of tyrosine metabolism discussed in Monoamine Metabolism

** Transient Tyrosinemia
 - one of the most common amino acid disorders
   - clinically asymptomatic
 - believed to be caused by late fetal maturation of
   4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
 - more common in premature infants than in full-term newborns
 - protein intake is an important aetiological factor
   - incidence has fallen dramatically in the last 4 decades, with the
     reduction in the protein content of newborn formula

* Tyrosinemia Type I
- Hepatorenal Tyrosinemia
** Clinical Presentation
- very variable, presents at any time from the neonatal period to adulthood
  - acute :: before 6 months of age with acute liver failure
  - subacute :: between 6 months and 1 year of age with liver disease,
                failure to thrive, coagulopathy, hepatosplenomegaly,
                rickets and hypotonia
  - chronic :: after the 1st year with chronic liver disease, renal
               disease, rickets, cardiomyopathy \pm porphyria-like
               syndrome

- liver is the major affected organ
  - morbidity and mortality
- renal disease is detected in most patients
  - proximal tubular disease
- acute neurological crisis can occur
  - painful paresthesias and autonomic signs that may progress to
    paralysis

** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH)
\ce{fumarylacetoacetate ->[FAH] fumarate + acetoacetate}
- mainly expressed in the liver and kidney
- compounds immediately upstream from the FAH reaction,
  maleylacetoacetate (MAA) and fumarylacetoacetate (FAA), and their
  derivatives, succinylacetone (SA) and succinylacetoacetate (SAA)
  accumulate and have important pathogenic effects
- effects of FAA and MAA occur only in the cells of the organs in which they are produced
  - these compounds are not found in body fluids of patients
- SA and SAA are readily detectable in plasma and urine and have
  widespread effects
- FAA, MAA and SA disrupt sulfhydryl metabolism by forming glutathione
  adducts \to free rad ical damage
- Disruption of sulfhydryl metabolism is also believed to cause
  secondary deficiency of two other hepatic enzymes,
  4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and methionine
  adenosyltransferase, resulting in hypertyrosinemia and
  hypermethioninemia
- SA is a potent inhibitor of ALAD

** Genetics
- AR, FAH
- most common mutation is c.1062+5G>A
  - is found in about 25% of the alleles worldwide
  - predominant mutation in the French-Canadian population, in which
    it accounts for >90% of alleles

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow SA in urine, plasma or DBS is pathognomonic
- \uparrow tyrosine
- \uparrow phenylalanine
- \uparrow methionine
- \uparrow urine ALA
- symptomatic patients, biochemical tests of liver function are
  usually abnormal
  - coagulopathy and/or hypoalbuminaemia
- acutely ill patients
  - \Uparrow \alpha-fetoprotein
  - Fanconi-type tubulopathy is often present with:
    - aminoaciduria, phosphaturia and glycosuria
    - radiological evidence of rickets may be present

** Treatment
- Nitisinone (aka: NTBC) is the recommended therapy, in combination
  with a tyrosine and phenylalanine restricted diet
  - inhibits 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase turning Type I into Type III
- nitisinone block tyrosine degradation at an early step
  - \downarrow FAA, MAA and SA
  - \uparrow tyrosine and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
- liver transplantation \to functional cure
  - normal diet
  - mortality and life long immunosuppressive therapy

* Tyrosinemia Type II
- Oculocutaneous Tyrosinemia
** Clinical Presentation
- any combination of: 
  - ocular lesions
  - skin lesions
  - neurological complications
- usually presents in infancy but can be any age

** Metabolic Derangement
- hepatic cytosolic tyrosine aminotransferase
\ce{tyrosine ->[TAT] 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate}
  - \uparrow tyrosine in CSF and serum
- \uparrow phenolic acids 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate,
  4-hydroxyphenyllactate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate

** Genetics
- AR, TAT

** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow plasma tyrosine > 1200 umol/L
  - if lower consider Type III
- Urine organic acids
  - \Uparrow urine 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  - \Uparrow 4-hydroxyphenyllactate
  - \Uparrow 4-hydroxyphenylacetate
  - \uparrow N-acetyltyrosine
  - \uparrow 4-tyramine

** Treatment
- tyrosine and phenylalanine restricted diet

* Tyrosinemia Type III
** Clinical Presentation
- very rare, 13 cases described
- most common long-term complication is intellectual impairment
** Metabolic Derangement
- 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
\ce{4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate ->[HPD] homogentisate}
- \uparrow plasma tyrosine
- \uparrow urine 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, 4-hydroxyphenyllactate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate
** Genetics 
- AR, HPD
** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow plasma tyrosine 300-1300 umol/L
- \uparrow urine 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, 4-hydroxyphenyllactate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate

* Alkaptonuria
** Clinical Presentation
- clinical symptoms first appear in adulthood
  - some cases diagnosed in infancy due to darkening of urine when
    exposed to air
- most prominent symptoms relate to joint and connective tissue involvement;
- significant cardiac disease and urolithiasis may be detected in later years
** Metabolic Derangement
- first identified IEM in 1902 by Garrod
- homogentisate dioxygenase expressed mainly in the liver and the
  kidneys
\ce{homogentisate ->[HGD] maleylacetoacetate}
- accumulation of homogentisate and its oxidised derivative
  benzoquinone acetic acid (the toxic metabolite) in various tissues
** Genetics
- AR, HGD
- 1:250000-1:1000000
** Diagnostic Tests
- Alkalinisation of the urine \to immediate dark brown colouration
- \uparrow urine homogentisate \to positive test for reducing substances
- \uparrow UOA homogentisic acid
** Treatment
- vitamin C
- nitisinone with \downarrow phe and tyr diet
  - 3-year clinical trial of nitisinone \to 95% \downarrow urine and plasma homogentisic acid
  - no demonstrable effects on clinical symptoms

* Hawkinsinuria
** Clinical Presentation
- only been described in a few families
- FTT and metabolic acidosis in infancy
- early weaning from breastfeeding seems to precipitate the disease
  - may be asymptomatic in breastfed infants

** Metabolic Derangement
- abnormal metabolites produced in hawkinsinuria
  - (hawkinsin (2-cysteinyl-1,4-dihydroxycyclohexenylacetate)
  - 4-hydroxycycloxylacetate)
- thought to derive from in-complete conversion of
  4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate caused by a defect in
  4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
\ce{4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate ->[HPD] homogentisate}
- hawkinsin is product of a reaction of an epoxide intermediate with
  glutathione, which may be depleted
- metabolic acidosis due to 5-oxoproline accumulation secondary to
  glutathione depletion

** Genetics
- AR, HPD
- mutations that lead to a retention of partial HPD function,
  - production of hawkinsin and 4-hydroxycyclohexylacetate
** Diagnostic Tests
- UAO hawkinsin or 4-hydroxycyclohexylacetate is diagnostic
- may be moderate tyrosinaemia, increased urinary
  4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and 4-hydroxyphenyllacate, metabolic
  acidosis and 5-oxoprolinuria during infancy

** Treatment
- return to breastfeeding or low tyr and phe diet
- asymptomatic after the 1st year of life
- affected infants are reported to have developed normally
