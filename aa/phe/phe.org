* Introduction
- Phe is an essential aromatic amino acid
- mainly metabolised in the liver by the PHE hydroxylase (PAH) system
- first step in the irreversible catabolism of Phe is hydroxylation to
  Tyr by PAH
- PAH requires the active pterin, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH_4)
- BH_4 is formed in three steps from GTP
  - also an obligate co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase
    - \therefore required for production of dopamine,catecholamines,
      melanin and serotonin
  - alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO) and nitric oxide synthase

- defects in PAH and those involving production or recycling of BH_4
  are associated with hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA)
- defects in PAH or production or recycling of BH_4 may result in:
  - hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA)
  - deficiency of TYR, L-dopa, dopamine, melanin, catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT)
- when hydroxylation to Tyr is impeded Phe can be transaminated to
  phenylpyruvate and further reduced and decarboxylated to
  phenyllactate and phenylacetate

* Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- natural history of PKU is for affected individuals to suffer
  progressive, irreversible neurological impairment during infancy and
  childhood
- untreated patients develop mental, behavioural, neurological and
  physical impairments
- most common outcome is a moderate to profound intellectual
  developmental disorder (IQ \le 50) often associated with:
  - mousey odour \to excretion of phenylacetic acid
  - reduced hair, skin and iris pigmentation \to reduced melanin synthesis
  - reduced growth and microcephaly
  - neurological impairments:
    - 25% epilepsy, 30% tremor, 5% spasticity of the limbs, 80% EEG abnormalities
- clinical phenotype correlates with Phe blood levels
  - reflects the degree of PAH deficiency
** Metabolic Derangement
- pathogenesis of brain damage in PKU is not fully understood
  - it is causally related to the \uparrow blood Phe
- Tyr becomes a semi-essential amino acid
  - \downarrow blood levels \to impaired synthesis of biogenic amines including:
    - melanin , dopamine and norepinephrine
- \uparrow blood PHE levels result in an imbalance of other large
  neutral amino acids (LNAA) within the brain
  - \to decreased brain concentrations of Tyr and serotonin
  - ratio of Phe levels in blood/brain is about 4:1

** Genetics 
- AR, PAH
- R408W mutation \sim 30% of alleles in Europeans with PKU
- genotypes correlate well with biochemical phenotypes, pre-treatment
  Phe levels and Phe tolerance

** Diagnostic Tests
- NBS for Phe and Phe/Tyr
- exclude cofactor defects via pterins in blood or urine and
  dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) in blood
- HPA may be found in preterm and sick babies particularly
  - after parenteral feeding with amino acids
  - liver disease (where blood levels of methionine, TYR,
    leucine/isoleucine are usually also raised)
  - treatment with inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. methotrexate, trimethoprim)
    - folate promotes recycling of BH_4
- plasma amino acids:
  - \uparrow Phe
  - \downarrow or normal Tyr
- phenylketones on urine organic acids:
  - phenylpyruvate
  - phenyllactate
  - phenylacetate
** Treatment
*** Diet
- reduce the blood Phe concentration sufficiently to prevent the
  neuropathological effects but also to fulfil age-dependent
  requirements for protein synthesis
- Blood Phe is primarily a function of residual PAH activity and Phe
  intake
*** BH_4
- pharmacological doses of BH_4 can reduce blood phenylalanine levels
  in some patients with PKU
- sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan), a synthetic formulation of the
  active 6R-isomer of BH_4 is approved in Europe and the USA for the
  treatment of responsive patients with HPA and PKU, of all ages
  - reduction of \ge30% in blood Phe level after a single dose
*** Alternative/Experimental
- liver transplantation
- phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)
  - converts Phe \to harmless transcinnamic acid
- large neutral amino acids
  - tyr, trp,leu, ile, val compete with phe for the same transport at
    the blood brain barrier

* Maternal PKU
** Clinical Presentation
- first description of maternal PKU syndrome (MPKUS) recognised the
  teratogenic effects of high maternal PHE levels
- offspring of women with untreated classical PKU suffer developmental
  delay, microcephaly, cardiac defects, low birth weight and
  dysmorphic features
- pathogenesis is poorly understood
** Metabolic Derangement
- maternal Phe \lt 360 umol/l \to no deleterious effect on the foetus
- maternal Phe \gt 360 Î¼mol/l, developmental indices decreased by
  about three points for every 60 umol/l rise in average maternal Phe
- \uparrow CHD \ge 900 umol/l
** Prevention
- plan pregnancy 
- start diet before conception
- monitoring expecting mothers 2x weekly

* HPA and Disorders of Biopterin Metabolism
- disorders of BH_4 associated with HPA and biogenic amine deficiency
  include deficiencies of:
  - GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH)
  - 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS)
  - dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR)
  - pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD)
- dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) due to a dominant form of GTPCH
  deficiency, and sepiapterin reductase (SR) deficiency (see Disorders of Monoamine Metabolism)
** Clinical Presentation
- can present in any of three ways:
  1) *asymptomatic* with raised Phe found following NBS; as part of
     the standard screening protocol the infant is then investigated
     further for biopterin defects
  2) *symptomatic* with neurological deterioration in infancy despite a
     low-Phe diet
     - this will occur where no further investigations are routinely
       undertaken after a finding of HPA in NBS which is wrongly
       assumed to be PAH deficiency
  3) *symptomatic* with neurological deterioration in infancy on a
     normal diet
     - this will occur either where there has been no NBS
       for HPA or if the PHE level is not sufficiently raised to have
       resulted in a positive screen or to require dietary treatment
** Metabolic Derangement
- associated with decreased activity of PAH, tyrosine hydroxylase,
  tryptophan hydroxylase and nitric oxide synthase (Figure [[fig:pah]])
- degree of HPA is highly variable
  - blood PHE concentrations ranging from normal to \gt2000 umol/l
  - CNS amine deficiency is most often profound and responsible for
    the clinical symptoms
  - decreased concentration of HVA in CSF is a measure of reduced
    dopamine turnover
  - 5-HIAA deficiency is a measure of reduced serotonin metabolism

** Genetics
- AR: GTPCH, PTPS, DHPR, PCD
- biopterin disorders account for 1-3% of infants found to have a
  raised PHE on newborn screening

** Diagnostic Tests
- urine or blood pterin analysis and blood DHPR assay
- BH_4 loading test
- CSF neurotransmitters
