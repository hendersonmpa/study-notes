* Introduction
- Phe is an essential aromatic amino acid
- mainly metabolised in the liver by the PHE hydroxylase (PAH) system
- first step in the irreversible catabolism of Phe is hydroxylation to
  Tyr by PAH
- PAH requires the active pterin, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH_4)
- BH_4 is formed in three steps from GTP
  - also an obligate co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase
    - \therefore required for production of dopamine,catecholamines,
      melanin and serotonin
  - alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO) and nitric oxide synthase

- defects in PAH and those involving production or recycling of BH_4
  are associated with hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA)
- defects in PAH or production or recycling of BH_4 may result in:
  - hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA)
  - deficiency of TYR, L-dopa, dopamine, melanin, catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT)
- when hydroxylation to Tyr is impeded, Phe may be transaminated to
  phenylpyruvic acid and further reduced and decarboxylated

* Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- natural history of PKU is for affected individuals to suffer
  progressive, irreversible neurological impairment during infancy and
  childhood
- untreated patients develop mental, behavioural, neurological and
  physical impairments
- most common outcome is a moderate to profound intellectual
  developmental disorder (IQ \le 50) often associated with:
  - mousey odour \to excretion of phenylacetic acid
  - reduced hair, skin and iris pigmentation \to reduced melanin synthesis
  - reduced growth and microcephaly
  - neurological impairments:
    - 25% epilepsy, 30% tremor, 5% spasticity of the limbs, 80% EEG abnormalities
- clinical phenotype correlates with Phe blood levels
  - reflects the degree of PAH deficiency
** Metabolic Derangement
- pathogenesis of brain damage in PKU is not fully understood
  - it is causally related to the \uparrow blood Phe
- Tyr becomes a semi-essential amino acid
  - \downarrow blood levels \to impaired synthesis of biogenic amines including:
    - melanin , dopamine and norepinephrine
- \uparrow blood PHE levels result in an imbalance of other large
  neutral amino acids (LNAA) within the brain
  - \to decreased brain concentrations of Tyr and serotonin
  - ratio of Phe levels in blood/brain is about 4:1

** Genetics 
- AR
- R408W mutation \sim 30% of alleles in Europeans with PKU
- genotypes correlate well with biochemical phenotypes, pre-treatment
  Phe levels and Phe tolerance

** Diagnostic Tests
- NBS for Phe and Phe/Tyr
- exclude cofactor defects via pterins in blood or urine and
  dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) in blood
- HPA may be found in preterm and sick babies particularly
  - after parenteral feeding with amino acids
  - liver disease (where blood levels of methionine, TYR,
    leucine/isoleucine are usually also raised)
  - treatment with inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. methotrexate, trimethoprim)
    - folate promotes recycling of BH_4


** Treatment
*** Diet
- reduce the blood Phe concentration sufficiently to prevent the
  neuropathological effects but also to fulfil age-dependent
  requirements for protein synthesis
- Blood Phe is primarily a function of residual PAH activity and Phe
  intake
*** BH_4
- pharmacological doses of BH_4 can reduce blood phenylalanine levels
  in some patients with PKU
- sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan), a synthetic formulation of the
  active 6R-isomer of BH_4 is approved in Europe and the USA for the
  treatment of responsive patients with HPA and PKU, of all ages
  - reduction of \ge30% in blood Phe level after a single dose
*** Alternative/Experimental
- liver transplantation
- phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)
  - converts Phe \to harmless transcinnamic acid
- large neutral amino acids
  - tyr, trp,leu, ile, val compete with phe for the same transport at
    the blood brain barrier

* Maternal PKU
** Clinical Presentation
- first description of maternal PKU syndrome (MPKUS) recognised the
  teratogenic effects of high maternal PHE levels
- offspring of women with untreated classical PKU suffer developmental
  delay, microcephaly, cardiac defects, low birth weight and
  dysmorphic features
- pathogenesis is poorly understood
** Metabolic Derangement
- maternal Phe \lt 360 umol/l \to no deleterious effect on the foetus
- maternal Phe \gt 360 Î¼mol/l, developmental indices decreased by
  about three points for every 60 umol/l rise in average maternal Phe
- \uparrow CHD \ge 900 umol/l
** Prevention
- plan pregnancy 
- start diet before conception
- monitoring expecting mothers 2x weekly
