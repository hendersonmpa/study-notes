#+TITLE: Amino Acid Transport

* Introduction
- epithelial cells in (for example) renal tubules and intestinal
  mucosa utilise several different amino acid transport systems which
  prefer amino acids with certain physicochemical properties
- inherited defects in amino acid transport at the cell membrane are
  usually expressed as selective renal aminoaciduria
  - the concentration of the affected amino acids is high in the urine
    while it is normal or low in plasma
- intestinal absorption of the affected amino acids is also almost
  always impaired
- clinical symptoms result from excess amounts of certain amino acids
  in the urine or lack of them in the tissues
** Dibasic Amino Acids
- cystine and structurally related dibasic cationic amino acids
  lysine, arginine and ornithine are transported from the intestinal
  or renal tubular lumen into epithelial cells by an apical
  transporter (system b^{0,+}) in exchange for neutral amino acids
- dibasic amino acids are then transported from the epithelial cell
  into the tissues by a basolateral dibasic amino acid transporter
  (system y^+L) in exchange for neutral amino acids and sodium
- both these transporters are heteromers of a heavy subunit and a
  light subunit linked by a disulfide bridge

** Neutral  Amino Acids
- alanine, asparagine, citrulline, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine,
  leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine
  and valine 
- transporter system for neutral amino acids is expressed only at the
  luminal border of epithelial cells
- it transports neutral amino acids into epithelial cells

** Dicarboxylic Amino Acids
- dicarboxylic amino acids (aspartate, glutamate) have a specific
  transporter EAAT3, located at the luminal border
  of epithelial cells and also expressed in neurons

* Cystinuria
** Clinical Presentation
- life-long risk of urolithiasis
- 1-2% of kidney stones in adults
- 6-8% of kidney stones in children
- recurrent urinary tract infections urinary obstruction and
  eventually renal failure are possible complications

** Metabolic Derangement
- defect in the high-affinity luminal transporter for cystine and the
  dibasic amino acids at the apical side of the epithelial cells of
  the proximal renal tubule and in jejunal mucosa 
  - system b^{0,+} consisting of two protein subunits rBAT and b^{0,+}AT
- absorption of cystine in the intestine and its reabsorption in the
  kidney is reduced
- normally 99% of filtered cystine is reabsorbed
- cystine is poorly soluble at neutral or low pH

** Genetics
- incidence \sim 1:7000
- type A, SLC3A1 (encodes rBAT)
  - AR, \gt 60% of cases
- type B, SLC7A9 (encodes b^{0,+}AT)
  - AD, incomplete penetrance
- homozygous contiguous gene deletions on chromosome 2p21 or 2p16
  - cystinuria associated with severe neurological findings (2p16) or
    Prader-Willi-like syndrome (2p21)

** Diagnostic Tests
- cystine stones IR-spectroscopy
- cyanide nitroprusside test
  - reacts with cystine \to purple colour
- urine amino acids
  - \Uparrow cystine
  - \uparrow arginine
  - \uparrow ornithine
  - \uparrow lysine
- plasma amino acids are normal
** Treatment
- \uparrow fluid intake
- alkalinisation of urine

* Lysinuric Protein Intolerance
** Clinical Presentation
- breast-fed newborns and infants are usually
  asymptomatic
- postprandial episodes of hyperammonaemia usually emerge when formula
  with higher protein content or supplementary high-protein foods are
  introduced
- hyperammonaemia may present as refusal to eat, vomiting, stupor and
  drowsiness leading to coma, and can be misdiagnosed as food
  protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome
- toddlers and school-age children present most often with growth
  failure and hepatosplenomegaly
- most patients develop a protective aversion to high-protein foods
  - impairs amino acid intake \to amino acid deficiencies

** Metabolic Derangement
- transport of the dibasic cationic amino acids lysine, arginine and
  ornithine is defective at the basolateral membrane of epithelial
  cells in the renal tubules and small intestine where y^+LAT1
  combines with 4F2hc to generate an active amino acid transporter
- massive amounts of lysine and more moderate amounts of arginine and
  ornithine are lost in the urine
- intestinal absorption is limited \to low plasma concentrations
- glutamine, glycine and alanine concentrations are often elevated due
  to malfunction of the urea cycle
- hyperammonaemia after protein ingestion and diminished protein
  tolerance in LPI resemble the symptoms of urea cycle enzyme
  deficiencies
  - best explained by functional deficiency of the intermediates
    arginine and ornithine in hepatocytes
- carnitine deficiency due to:
  - \downarrow meat intake
  - \downarrow endogenous biosynthesis due to lysine deficiency

** Genetics
- AR SLC7A7
  - y^+LAT-1 the light subunit of the dibasic amino acid
    transporter

** Diagnostic Tests
- combination of increased urinary excretion and low plasma
  concentrations of the cationic amino acids, especially lysine
- urine amino acids
  - \uparrow lysine
  - \uparrow arginine
  - \uparrow ornithine
  - N-\uparrow citrulline
- plasma amino acids
  - \downarrow lysine
  - \downarrow arginine
  - \downarrow ornithine
- \uparrow postprandial plasma ammonia
- postprandial orotic aciduria
- nonspecific almost constant findings include:
  - \uparrow serum LDH
  - \uparrow ferritin
  - \uparrow triglycerides
  - due to secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

** Treatment
- principal aims of the treatment are to:
  - prevent hyperammonaemia
  - provide a sufficient supply of protein and essential amino acids
    for normal metabolism and growth

- protein tolerance can be improved with supplementary low dose
  citrulline
- citrulline is readily absorbed and partially converted to arginine
  and ornithine which improves the function of the urea cycle
- carnitine supplementation for patients with carnitine deficiency

* Hartnup Disease
** Clinical Presentation
- classical symptoms of Hartnup disease are pellagra-like dermatitis,
  intermittent ataxia and neuropsychiatric abnormalities
  - resembles nutritional niacin deficiency
- identified by newborn urine amino acid screening
  - most remain asymptomatic

** Metabolic Derangement
- defective sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino
  acid transporter, B^{0}AT1 facing into the lumen of the renal proximal
  tubule and intestinal epithelium
- impair intestinal uptake and tubular reabsorption of all the neutral
  amino acids
  - alanine, serine, threonine,valine, leucine, isoleucine,
    phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine and citrulline
  - and monoamino-dicarboxylic amides asparagine and glutamine
- affected amino acids are readily absorbed in the intestine as short
  oligopeptides but not as free amino acids
  - excreted in 5- to 20-fold excess into the urine and feces
    - \therefore low plasma concentrations
- tryptophan deficiency \to development of clinical symptoms such as
  neuropsychiatric signs
  - precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin
  - reduced availability of nicotinic acid, the precursor of NADPH

** Genetics
- AR SLC6A19

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow urine neutral amino acids
- normal or low-normal concentrations in plasma 

** Treatment
- niacin
- adequate protein for tryptophan requirements
