* Introduction
- Non-Ketotic Hyperglycinemia (NKH) is a genetic disorder characterized
  by deficient activity of the *glycine cleavage system (GCS)*

- classic NKH is caused by mutations in genes that encode the protein
  components of the GCS
  - based on the clinical severity and developmental outcome classic
    NKH is further divided into:
    - severe classic NKH
    - attenuated classic NKH
- variant NKH has an overlapping phenotype w classic NKH
  - variant NKH is caused by: 
    1. lipoic acid biosynthesis defects
       - fits into the larger group of the lipoate synthesis
	 disorders
       - lipoate is a cofactor for:
	 - GCS
	 - pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
	 - \alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH)
	 - branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH)
       - lipoate disorders are also called multiple mitochondrial dysfunction
	 syndromes
    2. pyridox(am)ine 5-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency
       - leads to reduced activity of a large number of
         pyridoxal-P dependent reactions including the GCS
- phenocopies of NKH historically called transient NKH are non-genetic
  secondary causes of elevated plasma and CSF glycine levels
- atypical NKH is a heterogeneous historic term, which should no
  longer be used

* Clinical Presentation
** Severe Classic NKH
- neonatal onset
- hypotonia, increasing lethargy, coma, apnea, myoclonic jerks,
  seizures, and frequent hiccupping, which may have already started
  during the prenatal period
- 15-30% die in neonatal period
- developmental age of approximately six weeks

** Attenuated Classic NKH
- attain developmental milestones with varying degrees of
  developmental and intellectual progress
- may present in the neonatal period, resembling severe classic NKH,
  or later in infancy with hypotonia, lethargy, coma, and seizures
** Variant NKH
- lipoate deficiency combines the clinical findings of severe NKH with
  mitochondriopathies, such as leukoencephalopathy, optical atrophy,
  cardiomyopathy, and sometimes episodes of severe lactic acidosis
- PNPO deficiency may also resemble classic NKH but with a much more
  complex metabolic profile that includes a mildly elevated CSF
  glycine
  - symptoms are partly responsive to pyridoxal-P

* Metabolic Derangement
- glycine is involved in many biochemical reactions
- GCS breaks down glycine with tetrahydrofolate into carbon dioxide,
  ammonia and methylene-tetrahydrofolate
- four protein complex located in the mitochondrial matrix
  - H-protein carrying a lipoyl-group as the central core
- octanoate is synthesized by intramitochondrial fatty acid synthesis
  on the mitochondrial acylcarrier protein and is transferred to apo-H
  protein by lipoyltransferase 2 (LIPT2)
- lipoate synthase (LIAS) donates the sulfur atoms from its
  iron-sulfur cluster to build lipoyl-H
- lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) transfers the lipoate group from
  H-protein to the E2 component of four 2-ketodehydrogenases
- LIPT1 deficiency causes dysfunction of the E2 subunits of PDH, KGDH,
  and BCKDH (Figure [[fig:lip]])
- LIPT2 and LIAS add deficiency of the GCS
- some disorders of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis genes add deficient
  activity of complexes I and II of the respiratory chain and
  aconitase, which carry iron sulfur clusters
- in NKH glycine accumulates particularly in the brain
- glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter for the glycinergic
  receptors in the brain stem and spinal cord
  - possibly contributing to apnea and hypotonia
- in neuronal stem cells, the glycinergic receptor may be excitatory
  rather than inhibitory
- glycine is an allosteric activator of the excitatory
  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptor NR1/NR2 type
  - \uparrow glycine \to overactivation of this NMDA receptor
* Genetics
- classic NKH is AR
  - GLDC encoding the P-protein ~ 80%
  - AMT encoding the T-protein
  - no mutations identified in GCSH encoding the H-protein
- variant NKH is AR
  - genes involved in the synthesis of lipoate
    - LIAS, BOLA3, GLRX5, NFU1, ISCA2, LIPT1, LIPT2, and IBA57
  - PNPO deficiency
    - PNPO
* Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow glycine are found in plasma, urine, and CSF
  - \uparrow plasma glycine has low specificity
  - \uparrow CSF glycine is highly indicative of NKH
    - avoid blood contamination
  - \uparrow CSF glycine:plasma glycine
- valproate inhibits GCS
- molecular testing of GCS genes
- transient NKH is a phenocopy
  - elevated CSF glycine levels disappear spontaneously over the next
    days to weeks
- variant NKH manifest only mild elevations of glycine in plasma and CSF
  - may also have an increase of
    - plasma alanine, lactate and pyruvate
    - 2-ketoglutarate in urine organic acids
- in PNPO deficiency other results point to low pyridoxal phosphate
  including:
  - \downarrow CSF HVA and 5HIAA
  - \uparrow CSF 3-methoxytyrosine, glycine, threonine, histidine and
    taurine
  - \downarrow plasma arginine

* Treatment
- withdrawal of intensive care in the neonatal period is an ethical
  consideration given the very poor outcome in severe classic NKH
- correct distinction between severe and attenuated NKH can aid in
  this decision making
- reduction of glycine plasma levels by benzoate \to hippurate
  - monitor for carnitine deficiency
- glycine restricted diet
  - dietary glycine has a small contribution to glycine flux
- receptor agonists to block effects of glycine
