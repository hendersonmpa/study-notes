\section{Phenylalanine}
\label{sec:org47f3b3c}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgd04d767}
\begin{itemize}
\item Phe is an essential aromatic amino acid
\item mainly metabolised in the liver by the PHE hydroxylase (PAH) system
\item first step in the irreversible catabolism of Phe is hydroxylation to
Tyr by PAH
\item PAH requires the active pterin, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH\(_{\text{4}}\))
\item BH\(_{\text{4}}\) is formed in three steps from GTP
\begin{itemize}
\item also an obligate co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) required for production of dopamine,catecholamines,
melanin and serotonin
\end{itemize}
\item alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO) and nitric oxide synthase
\end{itemize}

\item defects in PAH and those involving production or recycling of BH\(_{\text{4}}\)
are associated with hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA)
\item defects in PAH or production or recycling of BH\(_{\text{4}}\) may result in:
\begin{itemize}
\item hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA)
\item deficiency of TYR, L-dopa, dopamine, melanin, catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT)
\end{itemize}
\item when hydroxylation to Tyr is impeded, Phe may be transaminated to
phenylpyruvic acid and further reduced and decarboxylated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency}
\label{sec:orga68b2b5}
\subsubsection{Clinical Presentation}
\label{sec:org8e77587}
\begin{itemize}
\item natural history of PKU is for affected individuals to suffer
progressive, irreversible neurological impairment during infancy and
childhood
\item untreated patients develop mental, behavioural, neurological and
physical impairments
\item most common outcome is a moderate to profound intellectual
developmental disorder (IQ \(\le\) 50) often associated with:
\begin{itemize}
\item mousey odour \(\to\) excretion of phenylacetic acid
\item reduced hair, skin and iris pigmentation \(\to\) reduced melanin synthesis
\item reduced growth and microcephaly
\item neurological impairments:
\begin{itemize}
\item 25\% epilepsy, 30\% tremor, 5\% spasticity of the limbs, 80\% EEG abnormalities
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item clinical phenotype correlates with Phe blood levels
\begin{itemize}
\item reflects the degree of PAH deficiency
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:org48cb9fc}
\begin{itemize}
\item pathogenesis of brain damage in PKU is not fully understood
\begin{itemize}
\item it is causally related to the \(\uparrow\) blood Phe
\end{itemize}
\item Tyr becomes a semi-essential amino acid
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) blood levels \(\to\) impaired synthesis of biogenic amines including:
\begin{itemize}
\item melanin , dopamine and norepinephrine
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) blood PHE levels result in an imbalance of other large
neutral amino acids (LNAA) within the brain
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\to\) decreased brain concentrations of Tyr and serotonin
\item ratio of Phe levels in blood/brain is about 4:1
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Genetics}
\label{sec:org251b776}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR, PAH
\item R408W mutation \(\sim\) 30\% of alleles in Europeans with PKU
\item genotypes correlate well with biochemical phenotypes, pre-treatment
Phe levels and Phe tolerance
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Diagnostic Tests}
\label{sec:orgded82f7}
\begin{itemize}
\item NBS for Phe and Phe/Tyr
\item exclude cofactor defects via pterins in blood or urine and
dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) in blood
\item HPA may be found in preterm and sick babies particularly
\begin{itemize}
\item after parenteral feeding with amino acids
\item liver disease (where blood levels of methionine, TYR,
leucine/isoleucine are usually also raised)
\item treatment with inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. methotrexate, trimethoprim)
\begin{itemize}
\item folate promotes recycling of BH\(_{\text{4}}\)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Treatment}
\label{sec:org1e465a5}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Diet
\label{sec:org8130b94}
\begin{itemize}
\item reduce the blood Phe concentration sufficiently to prevent the
neuropathological effects but also to fulfil age-dependent
requirements for protein synthesis
\item Blood Phe is primarily a function of residual PAH activity and Phe
intake
\end{itemize}
\item BH\(_{\text{4}}\)
\label{sec:orgd8e5035}
\begin{itemize}
\item pharmacological doses of BH\(_{\text{4}}\) can reduce blood phenylalanine levels
in some patients with PKU
\item sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan), a synthetic formulation of the
active 6R-isomer of BH\(_{\text{4}}\) is approved in Europe and the USA for the
treatment of responsive patients with HPA and PKU, of all ages
\begin{itemize}
\item reduction of \(\ge\)30\% in blood Phe level after a single dose
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Alternative/Experimental
\label{sec:orgffc98e2}
\begin{itemize}
\item liver transplantation
\item phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)
\begin{itemize}
\item converts Phe \(\to\) harmless transcinnamic acid
\end{itemize}
\item large neutral amino acids
\begin{itemize}
\item tyr, trp,leu, ile, val compete with phe for the same transport at
the blood brain barrier
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Maternal PKU}
\label{sec:org7cd6dc7}
\subsubsection{Clinical Presentation}
\label{sec:org2ed8f07}
\begin{itemize}
\item first description of maternal PKU syndrome (MPKUS) recognised the
teratogenic effects of high maternal PHE levels
\item offspring of women with untreated classical PKU suffer developmental
delay, microcephaly, cardiac defects, low birth weight and
dysmorphic features
\item pathogenesis is poorly understood
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:orgb61909a}
\begin{itemize}
\item maternal Phe \textless{} 360 umol/l \(\to\) no deleterious effect on the foetus
\item maternal Phe \textgreater{} 360 μmol/l, developmental indices decreased by
about three points for every 60 umol/l rise in average maternal Phe
\item \(\uparrow\) CHD \(\ge\) 900 umol/l
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Prevention}
\label{sec:org5880a19}
\begin{itemize}
\item plan pregnancy
\item start diet before conception
\item monitoring expecting mothers 2x weekly
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HPA and Disorders of Biopterin Metabolism}
\label{sec:orgb57b71a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Disorders of BH\(_{\text{4}}\) associated with HPA and biogenic amine deficiency
include deficiencies of:
\begin{itemize}
\item GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH)
\item 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS)
\item dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR)
\item pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD)
\end{itemize}
\item Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) due to a dominant form of GTPCH
deficiency, and sepiapterin reductase (SR) deficiency (see Disorders of Monoamine Metabolism)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Clinical Presentation}
\label{sec:org10819e9}
\begin{itemize}
\item can present in any of three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Asymptomatic, but with raised PHE found following NBS; as part of
the standard screening protocol the infant is then investigated
further for biopterin defects
\item Symptomatic, with neurological deterioration in infancy despite a
low-PHE diet. This will occur where no further investigations are
routinely undertaken after a finding of HPA in NBS which is
wrongly assumed to be PAH deficiency
\item Symptomatic, with neurological deterioration in infancy on a
normal diet. This will occur either where there has been no NBS
for HPA or if the PHE level is not sufficiently raised to have
resulted in a positive screen or to require dietary treatment
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:org8fd13df}
\begin{itemize}
\item associated with decreased activity of PAH, tyrosine hydroxylase,
tryptophan hydroxylase and nitric oxide synthase (Figure \ref{fig:orge4bc6ba})
\item degree of HPA is highly variable
\begin{itemize}
\item blood PHE concentrations ranging from normal to \textgreater{}2000 umol/l
\item CNS amine deficiency is most often profound and responsible for
the clinical symptoms
\item Decreased concentration of HVA in CSF is a measure of reduced
dopamine turnover
\item 5-HIAA deficiency is a measure of reduced serotonin metabolism
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Genetics}
\label{sec:orgf24f83a}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR: GTPCH, PTPS, DHPR, PCD
\item biopterin disorders account for 1-3\% of infants found to have a
raised PHE on newborn screening
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Diagnostic Tests}
\label{sec:org5e6ce8c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Urine or blood pterin analysis and blood DHPR assay
\item BH\(_{\text{4}}\) loading test
\item CSF neurotransmitters
\end{itemize}

\section{Tyrosine}
\label{sec:org67ed61c}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgc20e84a}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid derived from diet and hydroxylation of phenylalanine
\item a precursor of DOPA, thyroxine and melanin
\item glucogenic and ketogenic \(\to\) catabolism in liver cytosol \(\to\) fumarate and acetoacetate
\item Tyr \(\to\) 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate by cytosolic tyrosine aminotransferase
\begin{itemize}
\item also in liver and other tissues by mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase
\begin{itemize}
\item minor role under normal conditions
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item penultimate intermediates maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate
are reduced to succinylacetoacetate
\begin{itemize}
\item decarboxylation to succinylacetone
\item succinylacetone is the most potent known inhibitor of the heme biosynthetic enzyme ALAD
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
\item Five inherited disorders of tyrosine metabolism are known:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tyrosinemia type I is characterised by progressive
liver disease and renal tubular dysfunction with rickets
\item Tyrosinemia type II presents with keratitis and
blistering lesions of the palms and soles and neurological
complications
\item Tyrosinemia type III may be asymptomatic or associated with
mental retardation
\item Hawkinsinuria may be asymptomatic or present with failure to
thrive and metabolic acidosis in infancy
\item Alkaptonuria presents as adult with symptoms of osteoarthritis
\end{itemize}
\item Other inborn errors of tyrosine metabolism discussed in Monoamine Metabolism
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transient Tyrosinemia}
\label{sec:org33a7b92}
\begin{itemize}
\item one of the most common amino acid disorders
\begin{itemize}
\item clinically asymptomatic
\end{itemize}
\item believed to be caused by late fetal maturation of
4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
\item more common in premature infants than in full-term newborns
\item protein intake is an important aetiological factor
\begin{itemize}
\item incidence has fallen dramatically in the last 4 decades, with the
reduction in the protein content of newborn formula
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tyrosinemia Type I}
\label{sec:org341203d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hepatorenal Tyrosinemia
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Clinical Presentation}
\label{sec:org109402b}
\begin{itemize}
\item very variable, presents at any time from the neonatal period to adulthood
\begin{description}
\item[{acute}] before 6 months of age with acute liver failure
\item[{subacute}] between 6 months and 1 year of age with liver disease,
failure to thrive, coagulopathy, hepatosplenomegaly,
rickets and hypotonia
\item[{chronic}] after the 1st year with chronic liver disease, renal
disease, rickets, cardiomyopathy \textpm{} porphyria-like
syndrome
\end{description}

\end{itemize}
\ce{fumarylacetoacetate ->[FAH] fumarate + acetoacetate}
\begin{itemize}
\item mainly expressed in the liver and kidney
\item compounds immediately upstream from the FAH reaction,
maleylacetoacetate (MAA) and fumarylacetoacetate (FAA), and their
derivatives, succinylacetone (SA) and succinylacetoacetate (SAA)
accumulate and have important pathogenic effects
\item effects of FAA and MAA occur only in the cells of the organs in which they are produced
\begin{itemize}
\item these compounds are not found in body fluids of patients
\end{itemize}
\item SA and SAA are readily detectable in plasma and urine and have
widespread effects
\item FAA, MAA and SA disrupt sulfhydryl metabolism by forming glutathione
adducts \(\to\) free rad ical damage
\item Disruption of sulfhydryl metabolism is also believed to cause
secondary deficiency of two other hepatic enzymes,
4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and methionine
adenosyltransferase, resulting in hypertyrosinemia and
hypermethioninemia
\item SA is a potent inhibitor of ALAD
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item AR, FAH
\item most common mutation is c.1062+5G>A

\section{Sulfur Amino Acids}
\label{sec:org6f5c679}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgf4ee34b}
\begin{itemize}
\item methionine is converted by two methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT
I/III and MATII) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
\item methyl group of SAM is used in numerous methylation reactions,
yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
\item excess SAM is removed from the cycle by glycine N-methyltransferas (GNMT)
\item SAH is cleaved by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) to
homocysteine and adenosine, which is phosphorylated by adenosine
kinase (ADK)
\item homocysteine has two metabolic pathways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item remethylated back to methionine by the remethylation pathway or
using betaine as a methyl-group donor, in patients treated with
this drug
\item irreversibly metabolized to sulfate
by the transsulfuration pathway
\begin{itemize}
\item homocysteine and serine are condensed by cystathionine \(\beta\)-Synthase (CBS) to cystathionine
\item cystathionine is cleaved by cystathionine \(\gamma\)-lyase (CTH) to
form cysteine and \(\alpha\)-ketobutyrate
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item CTH can use cysteine and/or homocysteine to synthesize hydrogen
sulfide
\item cysteine can be further converted:
\begin{itemize}
\item in a series of reactions to taurine or
\item via the mitochondrial enzymes, AST and 3-mercaptopyruvate
sulfurtransferase (MPST), to pyruvate and hydrogen sulfide
\end{itemize}
\item mitochondrial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and of cysteine involves
several steps yielding thiosulfate , sulfite and finally sulfate
\item inorganic sulfur released from cysteine residues \(\to\) mitochondrial
iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster cofactors
\item availability of cysteine in the neonatal period is limited because
its endogenous synthesis from methionine by the transsulfuration
pathway is markedly attenuated
\item activity of the rate limiting enzyme in the pathway, cystathionase ,
is very low at birth and increases slowly during the first few months of life
\begin{itemize}
\item cysteine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid, at
least in preterm infants
\end{itemize}

\item disorders in sulfur amino acid metabolism exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item altered methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, sarcosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine,
total homocysteine or cystathionine concentrations in blood
\item adenosine or thiosulfate excretion in urine
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item CBS deficiency – classical homocystinuria – is the most common
disease in this group
\begin{itemize}
\item severity varies from
\begin{itemize}
\item multisystemic childhood condition with lens dislocation,
osteoporosis, marfanoid features, central nervous system and
vascular complications
\item isolated thromboembolic disease in adults.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item CTH deficiency appears to be a biochemical trait with no major
clinical sequelae
\item Disorders of cysteine and hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathway include:
\begin{itemize}
\item ethylmalonic encephalopathy
\item isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
\item combined sulfite oxidase deficiency
\begin{itemize}
\item due to impaired molybdenum cofactor synthesis
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item these are severe disorders with early-onset seizures and other
neurological complications
\begin{itemize}
\item other signs include orthostatic acrocyanosis, lens dislocation or
urolithiasis;
\end{itemize}
\item only molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A can be treated
successfully, with a synthetic cofactor
\end{itemize}

\section{Ornithine and Proline}
\label{sec:org584f2a2}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org387266e}
\begin{itemize}
\item ornithine is an intermediate in metabolic pathways involving the
urea cycle, proline metabolism and the biosynthesis of creatine and
polyamines
\item ornithine-\(\delta\)- aminotransferase (OAT) is a pyridoxal
phosphate-requiring, mitochondrial matrix enzyme that plays a
pivotal role in these pathways
\item OAT reaction is freely reversible:
\begin{itemize}
\item during the neonatal period the net flux is in the direction of
ornithine and, via the urea cycle, arginine biosynthesis
\item \textgreater{} few months of age the net flux reverses to favour arginine
disposal via the synthesis of \(\Delta\)1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
(P5C), an intermediate in proline and glutamate synthesis
\end{itemize}
\item ornithine also plays an essential role as the substrate for urea assembly
\item both OAT and OTC are mitochondrial matrix enzymes
\item ornithine produced in the cytoplasm from arginine is transported
into the mitochondrial matrix by an energy-requiring transport
system involving ORNT1
\begin{itemize}
\item an antiporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which exchanges
cytosolic ornithine with mitochondrial citrulline
\end{itemize}
\item in the cytoplasm ornithine is decarboxylated to putrescine which is
then converted to spermine
\item proline, unlike all other amino acids (except hydroxyproline), has
no primary amino group
\begin{itemize}
\item termed as an imino acid
\item \(\therefore\) uses a specific set of enzymes for metabolism
\end{itemize}
\item P5C is the product or precursor of the OAT reaction
\begin{itemize}
\item \ce{ ornithine + \alpha-KG <->[OAT] P5C + Glu}
\end{itemize}
\item P5C is precursor and degradation product of proline
\item P5C synthetase is a bifunctional ATP- and NADPH-dependent
mitochondrial enzyme that is highly active in the gut
\begin{itemize}
\item also expressed in brain catalyses the reduction of glutamate to

\section{Lysine and Cerebral OA Disorders}
\label{sec:org2fadd45}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org65cb484}
\begin{itemize}
\item lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan are thought to be degraded
within the mitochondrion
\item initially via separate pathways, which converge into a common 
pathway at:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde
\begin{itemize}
\item hydroxylysine catabolism and pipecolic acid pathway of lysine
catabolism
\end{itemize}
\item 2-oxoadipic acid
\begin{itemize}
\item tryptophan catabolism
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item the major route of lysine catabolism in most tissues is via the
bifunctional enzyme, 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde synthase (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} enzyme 1)
\item small amount of lysine is catabolised via pipecolic acid and the
peroxisomal key enzyme, pipecolic acid oxidase (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} enzyme 2)
\begin{itemize}
\item this pathway is the major route of lysine catabolism in the
brain
\end{itemize}
\item source of pipecolic acid is not yet fully understood
\begin{itemize}
\item from lysine and 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde shown
\item microbiome
\end{itemize}

\item 2-Oxoadipic acid is primarily converted to glutaryl-CoA by the
2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like complex (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} enzyme 6a)
since its E1 subunit (DHT-KD1) has a higher substrate affinity for
2-oxoadipic acid than the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in
the Krebs cycle (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} enzyme 6b)

\begin{itemize}
\item 2-Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, however, may serve as an
alternative route

\item 2-Oxoadipic acid is dehydrogenated and decarboxylated to
crotonyl-CoA by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} enzyme 7)
\begin{itemize}
\item tranfers electrons to FAD \(\to\) ETC via ETF/ETF-DH
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Crotonyl-CoA is subsequently converted to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA by
short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} crotonase, enzyme 8)
\begin{itemize}
\item this enzyme is multispecific and also acts as a crotonase in the
degradative pathways of valine, isoleucine and short-chain fatty
acids
\end{itemize}

\item 3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA is then converted to acetoacetyl-CoA by
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} enzyme 9)
\item glutaric acid which may derive from the intestinal microbiome,
spontaneous disintegration of glutaryl-CoA or other sources, is
normally reactivated by succinyl-CoA-dependent conversion of
succinate-hydroxymethylglutarate CoA transferase to glutaryl-CoA
(Figure \ref{fig:orgc4657a7} enzyme 10)

\item of the six enzyme deficiencies identified in the degradation of
lysine, only four \(\to\) neurometabolic disorders:
\begin{itemize}
\item antiquitin
\item KGDH
\item glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase
\item crotonase
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item a group of organic acid disorders presents exclusively with
progressive neurological symptoms of ataxia, epilepsy, myoclonus,
extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic stroke, and macrocephaly
\begin{itemize}
\item glutaric aciduria
\item 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria
\item 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria
\item N-acetylaspartic aciduria
\end{itemize}
\item in all these disorders the pathological compounds that accumulate
either are odd-chain dicarboxylic acids
\begin{itemize}
\item 3-hydroxyglutarate, glutarate
\begin{itemize}
\item sharing the same carbon backbone with the excitatory amino acid
glutamate (2-amino-glutarate)
\end{itemize}
\item or are neurotransmitters/-modulators
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\gamma\) -hydroxybutyrate
\item N-acetylaspartylglutamate
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

astrocytes and neurons
\item 3-hydroxyglutaric acid weakly activates glutamatergic neurotransmission

\section{Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia}
\label{sec:org1f4bce1}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgac6aa09}
\begin{itemize}
\item nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is a genetic disorder characterized
by deficient activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme
\item classic NKH is caused by mutations in genes that encode the protein
components of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS)
\item based on the clinical severity and developmental outcome, classic
NKH is further divided into:
\begin{itemize}
\item severe classic NKH
\item attenuated classic NKH
\end{itemize}
\item variant NKH has an overlapping phenotype to classic NKH
\begin{itemize}
\item is caused by mutations affecting the biosynthesis of the main
cofactor lipoic acid
\item fits into the larger group of the lipoate synthesis
disorders
\end{itemize}
\item lipoate is a cofactor for:
\begin{itemize}
\item GCS
\item pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
\item 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH)
\item branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH)
\end{itemize}
\item lipoate disorders are also called multiple mitochondrial dysfunction
syndromes
\item pyridox(am)ine 5-phosphate oxidase deficiency \(\to\) reduced activity
of a large number of pyridoxal-P-dependent reactions including the
GCS
\item phenocopies of NKH, historically called transient NKH, are
non-genetic secondary causes of elevated plasma and CSF glycine
levels
\item atypical NKH is a heterogeneous historic term, which should no
longer be used
\end{itemize}

mitochondriopathies, such as leukoencephalopathy, optical atrophy,
cardiomyopathy, and sometimes episodes of severe lactic acidosis
\item PNPO deficiency may also resembles classic NKH but with a much more
complex metabolic profile that includes a mildly elevated CSF
glycine
\begin{itemize}
\item symptoms are partly responsive to pyridoxal-P
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:orgcbddd5c}
\begin{itemize}
\item glycine is involved in many biochemical reactions
\item GCS breaks down glycine with tetrahydrofolate into carbon dioxide,
ammonia, and the generation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
\item a four protein complex located in the mitochondrial matrix
\begin{itemize}
\item H-protein carrying a lipoyl-group as the central core
\end{itemize}
\item octanoate is synthesized by intramitochondrial fatty acid synthesis
on the mitochondrial acylcarrier protein and is transferred to apo-H
protein by lipoyltransferase 2 (LIPT2)
\item lipoate synthase (LIAS) donates the sulfur atoms from its
iron-sulfur cluster to build lipoyl-H
\item lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) transfers the lipoate group from
H-protein to the E2 component of four 2-ketodehydrogenases
\item LIPT1 deficiency causes dysfunction of the E2 components
\item LIPT2 and LIAS add deficiency of the GCS
\item Some disorders of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis genes add deficient
activity of complexes I and II of the respiratory chain and
aconitase, which carry iron sulfur clusters
\item in NKH glycine accumulates particularly in the brain
\item glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter on the glycinergic
receptors in the brain stem and spinal cord
\begin{itemize}
\item possibly contributing to apnea and hypotonia
\end{itemize}
\item in neuronal stem cells, the glycinergic receptor may be excitatory
rather than inhibitory
\item glycine is an allosteric activator of the excitatory
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptor NR1/NR2 type
\item increased levels of glycine result in overactivation of this NMDA
receptor
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genetics}
\label{sec:org8cca547}
\begin{itemize}
\item classic NKH is AR
\begin{itemize}
\item GLDC encoding the P-protein \textasciitilde{} 80\%
\item AMT encoding the T-protein
\item no mutations identified in GCSH encoding the H-protein
\end{itemize}
\item variant NKH is AR
\begin{itemize}
\item genes involved in the synthesis of lipoate
\item LIAS, BOLA3, GLRX5, NFU1, ISCA2, LIPT1, LIPT2,and IBA57
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Diagnostic Tests}
\label{sec:orga3ef6e3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) glycine are found in plasma, urine, and CSF
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) plasma glycine has low specificity
\item \(\uparrow\) CSF glycine are highly indicative of NKH
\begin{itemize}
\item avoid blood contamination
\end{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) CSF:plasma glycine
\end{itemize}
\item valproate inhibits GCS
\item molecular testing of GCS genes
\item transient NKH is a phenocopy
\begin{itemize}
\item elevated CSF glycine levels disappear spontaneously over the next
days to weeks
\end{itemize}
\item variant NKH manifest only mild elevations of glycine in plasma and CSF
\begin{itemize}
\item may also have an increase of
\begin{itemize}
\item plasma alanine, lactate and pyruvate
\item 2-ketoglutarate in urine organic acids
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item in PNPO deficiency other results point to low pyridoxal phosphate
including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) CSF HVA and 5HIAA
\item \(\uparrow\) CSF 3-methoxytyrosine, glycine, threonine, histidine and
taurine
\item \(\downarrow\) plasma arginine
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Treatment}
\label{sec:org527636a}
\begin{itemize}
\item withdrawal of intensive care in the neonatal period is an ethical
consideration given the very poor outcome in severe classic NKH
\item correct distinction between severe and attenuated NKH can aid in
this decision making
\item reduction of glycine plasma levels by benzoate
\begin{itemize}
\item monitor for carnitine deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item glycine restricted diet
\begin{itemize}
\item dietary glycine has a small contribution to glycine flux
\end{itemize}
\item receptor agonists to block effects of glycine
\end{itemize}

\section{Glutamine, Serine and Asparagine}
\label{sec:orgd7a8f83}
\subsection{Glutamine Metabolism}
\label{sec:org01db6d4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gln is the most abundant amino acid
\item synthesized \emph{de novo} from glutamate and ammonia by glutamine synthetase
\begin{itemize}
\item the only way to produce glutamine in the human body
\item thereis no net absorption from the intestine
\end{itemize}
\item Gln plays a pivotal role in metabolism as constituent, precursor,
and amino moiety donor for many proteins, purines and pyrimidines,
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, adenosine-monophosphate, amino
acids and glucose
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Disorders}
\label{sec:org3e7d848}

\item one disorder of glutamine synthesis due to glutamine synthetase deficiency
\begin{itemize}
\item reported in only three patients
\item presented as newborns with epileptic encephalopathy
\item the outcome is very poor
\item not known if early start of glutamine therapy improves clinical
prognosis
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Serine Metabolism}
\label{sec:orgb4ba1e7}
\begin{itemize}
\item synthesized \emph{de novo} from glycolytic intermediate
3-phosphoglycerate
\begin{itemize}
\item can also be synthesized from glycine by serine
hydroxymethyltransferase
\end{itemize}
\item a precursor of a number of compounds that play and essential role in
neuronal development and function:
\begin{itemize}
\item D-serine
\item glycine
\item cysteine
\item serine phospholipids
\item sphingomyelins
\item cerebrosides (7 Chapter 38)
\end{itemize}
\item must be synthesized within the brain because of poor permeability
across the BBB
\begin{itemize}
\item synthesis is confined to astrocytes
\item shuttle to neuronal cells is performed by a dedicated neutral amino
acid transporter ASCT1
\end{itemize}
\item a major source of THF and of other one-carbon donors that are
required for the synthesis of purines and thymidine
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Disorders}
\label{sec:orgfa45b69}
\begin{itemize}
\item four disorders of serine metabolism are known

\item three are in biosynthesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency
\begin{itemize}
\item most have severe infantile phenotype called Neu-Laxova syndrome
\begin{itemize}
\item congenital microcephaly, intellectual disability and
intractable seizures

\item supplemented with glycine if unsatisfactory clinical response
\end{itemize}
\item phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency
\begin{itemize}
\item Neu-Laxova syndrome or milder phenotype
\item treated with oral serine and glycine
\end{itemize}
\item phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency

clinical response. Phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency

\subsection{Asparagine}
\label{sec:orgc8a3575}
\begin{itemize}
\item synthesized \emph{de novo} by asparagine synthetase (ASNS)
\begin{itemize}
\item catalyzes transfer of ammonia from glutamine to aspartic acid via
a \(\beta\)-aspartyl-AMP intermediate
\end{itemize}
\item must be synthesized within the brain because of poor permeability
across the BBB
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) asparagine synthesis is essential for the development
and function of the brain but not of other organs
\end{itemize}
\item ASNS is expressed at low levels in most tissues except the brain
\begin{itemize}
\item there is a brain-specific splice variant
\end{itemize}
\item a precursor of the glucogenic amino acid L-aspartate,
\begin{itemize}
\item a precursor of the neurotransmitter D-aspartate
\end{itemize}

protein glycosylation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Disorders}

\section{Transport}
\label{sec:org1e17dcc}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orge46314d}
\begin{itemize}
\item epithelial cells in (for example) renal tubules and intestinal
mucosa utilise several different amino acid transport systems which
prefer amino acids with certain physicochemical properties
\item cystine and structurally related dibasic cationic amino acids
lysine, arginine and ornithine are transported from the intestinal
or renal tubular lumen into epithelial cells by an apical
transporter (system b\(^{\text{0,+}}\)) in exchange for neutral amino acids
\item dibasic amino acids are then transported from the epithelial cell
into the tissues by a basolateral dibasic amino acid transporter
(system y\(^{\text{+L}}\)) in exchange for neutral amino acids and sodium
\item both these transporters are heteromers of a heavy subunit and a
light subunit linked by a disulfide bridge
\item a third transporter system for neutral amino acids is expressed only
at the luminal border of epithelial cells
\item it transports neutral amino acids into epithelial cells
\begin{itemize}
\item alanine, asparagine, citrulline, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine,
leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine
and valine
\end{itemize}
\item dicarboxylic amino acids (aspartate, glutamate) have a specific
transporter EAAT3, located at the luminal border
of epithelial cells and also expressed in neurons
\item cystinuria \(\to\) apical cystine/dibasic amino acid transporter
\item lysinuric protein intolerance  \(\to\) antiluminal dibasic amino acid transporter
\item Hartnup disorder \(\to\) luminal neutral amino acid transporter
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item inherited defects in amino acid transport at the cell membrane are
usually expressed as selective renal aminoaciduria
\begin{itemize}
\item the concentration of the affected amino acids is high in the urine
while it is normal or low in plasma
\end{itemize}
\item intestinal absorption of the affected amino acids is also almost
always impaired
\item clinical symptoms result from excess amounts of certain amino acids
in the urine or lack of them in the tissues
\begin{description}
\item[{cystinuria}] renal stones may be formed because of high urinary
concentration of poorly soluble cystine
\item[{LPI}] poor intestinal absorption and urinary loss of arginine,
ornithine and lysine
\begin{itemize}
\item patients develop protein intolerance with hyperammonaemia,
growth retardation and skeletal and immunological manifestations
\end{itemize}
\item[{Hartnup disease}] pellagra-like dermatitis and ataxia due to
deficiency of tryptophan, the precursor of niacin synthesis
\item[{iminoglycinuria and dicarboxylic aciduria}] mostly asymptomatic
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item life-long risk of urolithiasis
\item 1-2\% of kidney stones in adults
\item 6-8\% of kidney stones in children
\item recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary obstruction and,
finally, renal failure are possible complications
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:org97a8d2d}
\begin{itemize}
\item defect in the high-affinity luminal transporter for cystine and the
dibasic amino acids at the apical side of the epithelial cells of
the proximal renal tubule and in jejunal mucosa 
\begin{itemize}
\item system b\(^{\text{0,+}}\) consisting of two protein subunits rBAT and b\(^{\text{0,+}}\)AT
\end{itemize}
\item absorption of cystine in the intestine and its reabsorption in the
kidney is reduced
\item normally 99\% of filtered cystine is reabsorbed
\item cystine is poorly soluble at neutral or low pH
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Genetics}

\item \(\uparrow\) cystine
\item \(\uparrow\) arginine
\item \(\uparrow\) ornithine
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Treatment}
\label{sec:org89a90b6}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) fluid intake
\item alkalinisation of urine
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lysinuric Protein Intolerance}
\label{sec:org39bc669}
\subsubsection{Clinical Presentation}
\label{sec:org4bcf89d}
\begin{itemize}
\item breast-fed newborns and infants are usually
asymptomatic
\item postprandial episodes of hyperammonaemia usually emerge when formula
with higher protein content or supplementary high-protein foods are
introduced
\item hyperammonaemia may present as refusal to eat, vomiting, stupor and
drowsiness leading to coma, and can be misdiagnosed as food
protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome
\item toddlers and school-age children present most often with growth
failure and hepatosplenomegaly
\item most patients develop a protective aversion to high-protein foods
\begin{itemize}
\item impairs amino acid intake \(\to\) amino acid deficiencies
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:orga6201fb}
\begin{itemize}
\item transport of the dibasic cationic amino acids lysine , arginine and
ornithine (system y\(^{\text{+L}}\)) is defective at the basolateral membrane of
epithelial cells in the renal tubules and small intestine where
y\(^{\text{+LAT1}}\) combines with 4F2hc to generate an active amino acid
transporter
\item massive amounts of lysine and more moderate amounts of arginine and
ornithine are lost in the urine
\item intestinal absorption is limited \(\to\) low plasma concentrations
\item glutamine, glycine and alanine concentrations are often elevated due
to malfunction of the urea cycle
\item hyperammonaemia after protein ingestion and diminished protein
tolerance in LPI resemble the symptoms of urea cycle enzyme
deficiencies
\item best explained by functional deficiency of the intermediates
arginine and ornithine in hepatocytes
\item carnitine deficiency due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\downarrow\) meat intake
\item \(\downarrow\) endogenous biosynthesis due to lysine deficiency
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Genetics}
\label{sec:org108a9fa}
\begin{itemize}
\item AR, SLC7A7
\begin{itemize}
\item y\(^{\text{+LAT}}\)-1 the light subunit of the dibasic amino acid
transporter
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Diagnostic Tests}
\label{sec:org674a136}
\begin{itemize}
\item diagnosis LPI is based on the combination of increased urinary
excretion and low plasma concentrations of the cationic amino acids,
especially lysine
\item \(\uparrow\) urine lysine, arginine and ornithine
\item \(\downarrow\) plasma lysine, arginine and ornithine
\item \(\uparrow\) postprandial plasma ammonia
\item postprandial orotic aciduria
\item nonspecific but almost constant findings include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\)  serum LDH
\item \(\uparrow\) ferritin
\item \(\uparrow\) triglycerides
\end{itemize}
\item due to secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Treatment}
\label{sec:orged48865}
\begin{itemize}
\item principal aims of the treatment are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item prevent hyperammonaemia
\item provide a sufficient supply of protein and essential amino acids
for normal metabolism and growth
\end{itemize}

\item Protein tolerance can be improved with supplementary low dose
citrulline
\item citrulline is readily absorbed and partially converted to arginine
and ornithine which improves the function of the urea cycle
\item carnitine supplementation for patients with carnitine deficiency
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hartnup Disease}
\label{sec:org1eaba86}
\subsubsection{Clinical Presentation}
\label{sec:org9bd25a7}

\begin{itemize}
\item resembles nutritional niacin deficiency
\end{itemize}
\item identified by newborn urine screening
\begin{itemize}
\item most remain asymptomatic
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:orgff9114d}
\begin{itemize}
\item defective sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino
acid transporter, B(0)AT1 in the apical brush border membrane of
renal proximal tubule and intestinal epithelium
\item impair intestinal uptake and tubular reabsorption of all the neutral
amino acids
\begin{itemize}
\item alanine, serine, threonine,valine, leucine, isoleucine,
phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine and citrulline
\item and monoamino-dicarboxylic amides asparagine and glutamine
\end{itemize}
\item affected amino acids are readily absorbed in the intestine as short
oligopeptides but not as free amino acids
\begin{itemize}
\item excreted in 5- to 20-fold excess into the urine and feces
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\therefore\) low plasma concentrations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item tryptophan deficiency \(\to\) development of clinical symptoms such as
neuropsychiatric signs
\begin{itemize}
\item precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin
\item reduced availability of nicotinic acid, the precursor of NAD(P)H
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Genetics}
