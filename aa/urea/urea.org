#+TITLE: Urea Cycle

* Introduction
- urea cycle is the main route for ammonia detoxification
- defects generally cause hyperammonaemia
- complete cycle is found only in periportal hepatocytes
- involves two mitochondrial and three cytosolic enzymes as well as
  the mitochondrial ornithine/citrulline antiporter and the activating
  mitochondrial enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase, which turns the
  cycle on or off
- required intermediates supplied by:
  - carbonic anhydrase Va (CAVA) \to bicarbonate
  - aspartate/glutamate mitochondrial antiporter citrin \to aspartate
  - \Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) \to /de novo/ ornithine

* Mitochondrial Urea Cycle Disorders
- CPS, OTC and NAGs deficiency
- exclusive role of NAGS is to produce NAG the essential activator of CPS1
  - \therefore NAGS deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from
    CPS1 deficiency
- OTC deficiency is the most frequent urea cycle error (about 60% of UCD patients)
- CPS1 and NAGS deficiency are very rare \lt 1:1,000,000 live births

** Clinical Presentation
- acute hyperammonaemia presenting as encephalopathy
- NAGS, CPS1 and OTC catalyse the initial two steps of the UC
  - ammonia \to carbamoyl phosphate \to citrulline
  - \therefore produce the \Uparrow ammonia among UCDs
