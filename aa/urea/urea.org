#+TITLE: Urea Cycle
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
- urea cycle is the main route for ammonia detoxification
- defects generally cause hyperammonaemia
- complete cycle is found only in periportal hepatocytes
- involves two mitochondrial and three cytosolic enzymes as well as
  the mitochondrial ornithine/citrulline antiporter and the activating
  mitochondrial enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase, which turns the
  cycle on or off
- required intermediates supplied by:
  - carbonic anhydrase Va (CAVA) \to bicarbonate
  - aspartate/glutamate mitochondrial antiporter citrin \to aspartate
  - \Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) \to /de novo/ ornithine

* Mitochondrial 
- CPS, OTC and NAGs deficiency
- exclusive role of NAGS is to produce NAG the essential activator of CPS1
  - \therefore NAGS deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from
    CPS1 deficiency
- OTC deficiency is the most frequent urea cycle error (about 60% of UCD patients)
- CPS1 and NAGS deficiency are very rare \lt 1:1,000,000 live births

** Clinical Presentation
- acute hyperammonaemia presenting as encephalopathy
- NAGS, CPS1 and OTC catalyse the initial two steps of the UC
  - ammonia \to carbamoyl phosphate \to citrulline
  - \therefore produce the \Uparrow ammonia of all UCDs
*** Newborns
- healthy at birth but may present by day 2 with a rapidly
  progressing encephalopathy
- presentation similar to bacterial sepsis, which can lead to
  significant delay in the start of specific management for
  hyperammonaemia
  - vomiting, refusal to feed, somnolence/stupor/coma, muscular
    hypotonia, seizures, hyper- or hypoventilation, and hypo- or
    hyperthermia
  - respiratory alkalosis is common

*** Children and Adults
- variable
- present during or shortly after an intercurrent infection or any
  other catabolic situation or following a high-protein meal

*** Female OTC Carriers
- variable individual inactivation of the X-chromosome hosting the
  mutant OTC gene, they have highly variable residual OTC function
  - some are asymptomatic
  - others report symptoms over many years that are likely explained
    by recurrent undiagnosed hyperammonaemia often detected only after
    a male offspring is diagnosed
  - others present with frank deficiency

** Metabolic Derangement
- \Downarrow citruline production
- failure to incorporate ammonia into carbamoyl phosphate (CP)
  explains the hyperammonaemia of CPS1 and NAGS deficiency
- in OTC deficiency it may be due to CPS1 inhibition by CP
  that accumulates in the mitochondria.
- some CP leaks out of the mitochondria, leading to excessive
  pyrimidine biosynthesis and overproduction of orotic acid and
  uracil
- \uparrow urine excretion of orotic acid and uracil differentiates
  conditions in which CP accumulates, such as OTC deficiency, from
  those with normal or low CP, such as CPS1 and NAGS deficiencies
- ammonia is neurotoxic
  - NH_3 freely enters brain and is converted to non-permeable
    \ce{NH4+}
- \uparrow ammonia + glutamine synthetase \to \uparrow glutamine
  - increase can occur before, and can persist after, hyperammonaemia
  - Other non-essential amino acids that can be made from ammonia are increased:
  - glycine, serine, glutamate and alanine

** Genetics
- AR, NAGS & CPS1
- X-linked, OTC

** Diagnostic Tests
- hallmark is hyperammonaemia, generally in the absence of
  hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis or ketonuria
- diagnostic algorithm (Figure [[fig:dd]])

** Treatment
*** Emergency
- stop natural protein intake
- stop catabolism with supplementation
- reduce ammonia with drugs \pm dialysis

- sodium benzoate and/or sodium phenylbutyrate (Figure [[fig:nh3]])

- phenylbutyrate is a prodrug
  - first converted to phenylbutyryl-CoA and then metabolized by mitochondrial
    beta-oxidation to the active phenylacetate
  - phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine,
    which is eliminated with the urine
  - phenylacetylglutamine contains the same amount of nitrogen as
    urea, which makes it an alternative to urea for excreting nitrogen

- sodium benzoate combines with glycine to form hippuric acid which is
  then excreted
  - this begins with the conversion of benzoate by butyrate-CoA ligase
    into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA which is then
    metabolized by glycine N-acyltransferase into hippuric acid

*** Prognosis
- presentation during newborn period have high risk of death

- severe CPS1 and OTC deficiencies are prone to recurrent
  hyperammonaemic crises
  - low protein diet
  - avoid catabolism, monitor plasma amino acids
  - nitrogens scavengers: sodium benzoate, phenylbutyrate
  - should undergo liver transplantation as soon as it is possible and safe
- NAGS deficiency is the only UCD for which drug treatment is almost
  curative
  - N-carbamyl-L-glutamate (also known as carglumic acid ; licensed
    drug Carbaglu )
  - a synthetic analogue of the physiological activator of CPS1, NAG,
    given orally activates CPS1 and thereby urea cycle function

* Cytosolic
- ASS, ASL, ARG1
- second most frequent among the UCDs
  - ASS and ASL deficiency, each represent \sim 15%
  - ARG1 deficiency representing 3%

** Clinical Presenation
*** Newborns
- ASS and ASL presentation resembles mitochondrial UCDs
  - hyperammonaemic encephalopathy of similar severity
  - peak plasma ammonia may not be as high
  - onset delayed to day 6â€“7 of life or even later
- ARG1 deficiency rarely presents in the newborn period

*** Children and Adults
- ASS and ASL similar to mitochondrial UCDs
- risk of hyperammonaemic decomposition: ASS \gt ASL
- brittle hair due to trichorrhexis nodosa is almost pathognomonic for ASL deficiency
  - results from arginine deficiency, responding to arginine
    administration
- ARG1 is differs from ASL/ASS
  - developmental delay with neurological and intellectual impairment
  - growth retardation and spastic cerebral palsy
  - seizures

** Metabolic Derangement
- ASS
  - \Uparrow citrulline
  - \downarrow ASA
  - \downarrow arginine
- ASL
  - \uparrow citrulline
  - \uparrow ASA
  - \downarrow arginine
- ARG1
  - \uparrow citrulline
  - \uparrow arginine
  - induction in extrahepatic tissues of ARG2 may explain the modest
    increase (about 15-fold) of plasma arginine, and the normal or
    near-normal plasma ornithine


- citrulline and argininosuccinate include one molecule of ornithine
  and one(cit) or two(ASA) atoms of waste nitrogen
  - urinary excretion of these intermediates in ASS and ASL
    deficiencies effectively removes waste nitrogen
  - with simultaneous loss of two (ASS) or one (ASL) ornithine
    molecules per urea
  - \therefore ornithine is essential in waste nitrogen is excretion
    in ASS and ASL deficiencies
    - administration of arginine, converted to ornithine upon cleavage by arginase

** Genetics
- AR, ASS1, ASL, ARG1

** Diagnostic Tests
- plasma amino acids (see above for pattern)
- diagnostic algorithm (Figure [[fig:dd]])

** Treatment
- emergency management the same as mitochondrial UCDs
  - ASL give arginine
- maintenance treatment for ASS and ASL deficiencies is the same as
  CPS1 and OTC deficiencies
- liver transplant should be considered in ASS, ASL and ARG1

* Mitochondrial Transport
** HHH Syndrome
- see section [[Ornithine and Proline]]
** Citrin Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
 - hepatic mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate antiporter citrin
   - supplies aspartate for the ASS reaction
 - two main age dependent clinical presentations:
   - Neonatal Intrahepatic Cholestasis Caused by Citrin Deficiency (NICCD)
   - citrullinemia type II (CTLN2)
     - occurs in adolescents and adults
 - third less common clinical phenotype is Failure To Thrive and
   Dyslipidemia Caused by Citrin Deficiency (FTTDCD) may also occur in
   childhood

*** Metabolic Derangement
 - exchange of mitochondrial aspartate for cytosolic glutamate and
   the malate/aspartate shuttle are both affected
 - insufficient supply of mitochondrial aspartate for ASS within
   hepatocytes, and the conversion of the fumarate released by ASL, to
   form aspartate within the cytosol, is impaired, due to the low
   cytosolic NAD resulting from lack of malate-aspartate shuttle
   operation
   - this shuttle transfers reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH
     to the mitochondria, regenerating NAD in the cytosol
 - low cytosolic aspartate decreases liver ASS activity, resulting in
   citrulline accumulation, and also impairs protein and pyrimidines
   synthesis in liver cells
   - both process es are cytosolic and use aspartate, explaining the
     hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia of NICCD and the lack of
     urinary orotic acid that differentiates citrin deficiency from
     ASS deficiency
 - high cytosolic NADH/NAD ratios in the liver explain the
   hypoglycaemia and the galactosaemia that are frequently observed in
   NICCD
 - cytosolic NAD is needed both for gluconeogenesis from lactate and
   for UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose conversion

*** Genetics
-AR, SLC25A13

*** Diagnostic Tests
- newborns with intrahepatic cholestasis the finding of:
  - increased plasma citrulline
  - without significant hyperammonaemia
  - normal or elevated levels of arginine
  - without urinary orotic acid
  - high plasma level of alpha-fetoprotein
  - and/or increased galactose
- strongly suggestive of  NICCD

*** Treatment
- avoid carbohydrate or glycerol infusions \to hyperammonaemia
- maintenance treatment of NICCD involves the use of lactose-free or
  MCT-enriched formula
- when introduced, other foods should be proteinrich and fat-rich,
  such as eggs or fish
* Ancillary Enzymes
** P5CS
- see section [[Ornithine and Proline]]
** CAVA
- carbonic anhydrase Va (CAVA) deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- neonatal symptoms identical to those with neonatal onset UCD
*** Metabolic Derangement
- bicarbonate cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane
- spontaneous conversion of CO_2 to bicarbonate is too slow for the
  needs of urea synthesis
- CAVA accelerates this conversion within liver mitochondria
  - supplying the bicarbonate used intramitochondrially by:
    - CPS1
    - pyruvate carboxylase
    - propionyl CoA carboxylase
    - 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase
- \therefore CAVA deficiency impairs:
  - urea cycle
  - gluconeogenesis
  - BCAA metabolism
- has an unusual combination of biochemical findings:
  - hyperammonaemia
  - decreased plasma citrulline
  - absence of urinary orotic acid
  - hypoglycaemia
  - metabolic acidosis
  - high plasma lactate
  - urinary ketone bodies
  - UOA contains carboxylase-related metabolites (see multiple carboxylase deficiency)

*** Genetics
- AR, CA5A

*** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow plasma ammonia
- \uparrow blood lactate
- \uparrow urine ketone bodies
- \downarrow blood glucose
- \downarrow citrulline 
- urine organic acids for carboxylase metabolites
- normal plasma acylcarnitines

*** Treatment
- emergency management for CAVA deficiency is mainly symptomatic
  - focusing on treating hyperammonaemia as for intramitochondrial UCDs
- good outcome
