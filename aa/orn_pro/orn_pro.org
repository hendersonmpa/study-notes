* Introduction
** Ornitine
- ornithine is an intermediate in metabolic pathways involving the
  urea cycle, proline metabolism and the biosynthesis of creatine and
  polyamines (e.g. putrescine and spermine)

- ornithine-\delta- aminotransferase (OAT) is a pyridoxal
  phosphate-requiring, mitochondrial matrix enzyme that plays a
  pivotal role in these pathways

 \ce{ornithine + \alpha-KG <->[OAT] P5C + glutamate}
- OAT reaction is freely reversible:
  - *during the neonatal period the net flux is in the direction of*
    *ornithine and, via the urea cycle, arginine biosynthesis*
  - *\gt few months of age the net flux reverses to favour arginine*
    *disposal via the synthesis of \Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate*
    *(P5C), an intermediate in proline and glutamate synthesis*
- ornithine also plays an essential role as the substrate for urea assembly
- ornithine produced in the cytoplasm from arginine is transported
  into the mitochondrial matrix by an energy-requiring transport
  system involving ORNT1
  - an antiporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which exchanges
    cytosolic ornithine with mitochondrial citrulline
  - defective in HHH syndrome (Section [[HHH Syndrome]])
- in the cytoplasm ornithine is decarboxylated to putrescine which is
  then converted to spermine

** Proline
- proline unlike all other amino acids (except hydroxyproline) has
  no primary amino group \therefore an imino acid
  - \therefore uses a specific set of enzymes for metabolism

- pyridinoline ring of proline and hydroxyproline contribute to the
  structural stability of proteins particularly collagen
- P5C is the product/precursor of the OAT reaction
- P5C is precursor/degradation product of proline
- P5C synthetase is a bifunctional ATP and NADPH-dependent
  mitochondrial enzyme that is highly active in the gut
  - also expressed in brain catalyses the reduction of glutamate to
    P5C
- P5C/proline cycle transfers reducing/oxidizing potential between
  cellular organelles

* OAT Deficiency
- Gyrate Atrophy of the Choriod Retina 
** Clinical Presentation
- initial symptoms myopia, night blindness in early-mid childhood
- fundoscopic appearance of the chorioretinal atrophy in OAT deficiency is highly specific
  - chorioretinal atrophy is progressive \to blindness by 45-65 years

** Metabolic Derangement
- OAT is PLP dependent
  - there is a PLP responsive variant
*** Neonatal period
- present with increased blood ammonia and low levels of plasma
  ornithine, citrulline, arginine and orotic aciduria in their first
  weeks of life
- hyperornithinaemia develops later in life
- net flux in the OAT reaction in the newborn period is in the
  direction of ornithine synthesis rather than degradation
- disruption of the anapleurotic function of the OAT reaction for the
  urea cycle can lead to
  - insufficient levels of citrulline and arginine
  - inadequate ureagenesis and consequent hyperammonaemia
*** Non-neonatal
- patients develop hyperornithinaemia
  - fasting plasma ornithine in the range of 400-1200 uM
- mechanism of the retinal degeneration is unclear
- reduced levels of creatine in blood, urine, muscle and brain
  - inhibition of AGAT by \uparrow ornithine

** Genetics
- AR OAT

** Diagnostic Tests
- most prominent biochemical abnormality in those ingesting an
  unrestricted diet:
  - \Uparrow 5- to 20-fold plasma ornithine
- \uparrow urine ornithine
- when plasma ornithine \gt 400 uM
  - \uparrow urine ornithine, lysine, arginine, cystine
  - secondary to competitive inhibition of shared dibasic aa renal transporter
- differentiated from HHH by lack of homocitrulline in urine
- *difficult to distinguish neonatal OAT from OTC* in both disorders:
  - \downarrow plasma ornithine, arginine, and citrulline
  - \uparrow urine orotic acid
- molecular and enzyme confirmation

** Treatment
- restrict arginine to reduce plasma ornithine levels \lt 200 uM
- \uparrow dose PLP works in subset of responsive patients

* HHH Syndrome
- Hyperornithinaemia, Hyperammonaemia and Homocitrullinuria syndrome

\end{center}
#+END_EXPORT
** Clinical Presentation
- broad spectrum, with some related to episodic hyperammonemia
- intolerance to protein feeding, vomiting, seizures and developmental
  delay from infancy are common
- neonatal onset of lethargy, hypotonia and seizures, with progression
  to coma and death observed in the most severe form
- liver failure/dysfunction
- can be chronic and progressive
  - food aversion, central and peripheral neurological dysfunction

** Metabolic Derangement
- HHH syndrome is a disorder of metabolic compartmentation, with
  impaired importation of ornithine into the mitochondria
- results in deficiency of OTC and OAT activity with:
  - \Uparrow plasma ornithine
  - \Uparrow plasma ammonia
- \downarrow intramitochondrial ornithine \to utilisation of
  carbamoyl-phosphate by other pathways with formation of:
  - homocitrulline from lysine
  - orotic acid 

\ce{carbamoyl-P + lysine -> homocitrulline}

** Genetics
- AR ORNT1 (aka SLC24A15)
- more frequent in Canada, as a result of a founder mutation in Quebec

** Diagnostic Tests
- can be differentiated from other hyperammonaemic syndromes by laboratory findings
- \Uparrow plasma ornithine
- \Uparrow plasma ammonia
- \uparrow urine homocitrulline
- above triad is pathognomonic
- plasma ornithine concentration is elevated to 3 to 10 fold
  - lower than in OAT deficiency
- plasma citrulline reduction is less pronounced than in OTC
  deficiency
- when plasma ornithine \gt 400 uM
  - \uparrow urine ornithine, lysine, arginine, cystine
  - secondary to competitive inhibition of shared dibasic aa renal
    transporter
- orotic aciduria is common in HHH

** Treatment
- prevent ammonia toxicity
- low protein diet
- citruline and arginine supplementation
- ammonia scavengers are used:
  - sodium benzoate
  - sodium phenylbutyrate
- prognosis variable, generally good

* P5CS  Deficiency
- Hypoprolinaemia
** Clinical Presentation
- central and peripheral neurological
  - progressive ID
- cataracts
- joint hypermobility
- see figure [[fig:diff]] for details

** Metabolic Derangement
- *\Delta1-Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Synthetase (P5CS)* deficiency
- P5CS catalyses an essential step in synthesis of proline, ornithine
  and arginine from glutamate

\ce{glutamate ->[P5CS] P5C}

- pattern of metabolic abnormalities consistent with impaired proline
  and ornithine synthesis 
- hypoornithinaemia, hypocitrullinaemia, hypoargininaemia,
  hypoprolinaemia and mild hyperammonaemia

** Genetics 
- AR/AD ALDH18A1

** Diagnostic Tests
- abnormal metabolite profile is corrected in the fed state
  - \therefore the metabolic phenotype of P5CS deficiency is easily
    missed
- combination of the following should suggest this disorder:
  - \downarrow fasting: ornithine, citrulline, arginine and proline
  - tendency to paradoxical fasting hyperammonaemia
  - or one of the above together with a clinical phenotype of mental
    retardation, connective tissue manifestations and/or cataracts

** Treatment
- supplementation of the deficient amino acids seems to be a
  reasonable therapeutic approach

* Proline Oxidase Deficiency
- Hyperprolinaemia Type I
** Clinical Presentation
- well tolerated in some individuals
- may contribute to risk for schizophrenia or other psychiatric,
  cognitive or behavioural abnormalities

** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of *proline oxidase* a mitochondrial inner-membrane
  enzyme

\ce{proline ->[POX] P5C}

** Genetics
- AR PRODH
- maps to 22q11, in the region deleted in the velocardiofacial
  syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome

** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow plasma proline
  - usually \le 2000 uM (normal range 100-450 uM)
- \uparrow urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proline
- hyperprolinaemia (as high as 1000 Î¼M) is also observed as a
  secondary phenomenon in hyperlactataemia
  - possibly because proline oxidase is inhibited by lactic acid
  - alanine will also elevated in this situation
** Treatment
- prognosis excellent
- no treatment needed

* P5CDH Deficiency
- Hyperprolinaemia Type II

** Clinical Presentation
- relatively benign disorder
- attenuated phenotype
- ~ 50% present with seizures
** Metabolic Derangement
- *pyrroline 5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase* deficiency
  - mitochondrial inner-membrane enzyme involved in the conversion of
    proline into glutamate

  \ce{P5C ->[P5CDH] glutamate}

- accumulating P5C is a vitamin B_6 antagonist due to adduct
  formation
- seizures may be due to vitamin B_6 inactivation

** Genetics
- AR ALDH4A1

** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow plasma proline and P5C
  - proline \gt 2000 uM (normal range 100-450 uM)
- \uparrow urine and CSF proline and P5C
** Treatment
- seizures are pyridoxine (B_6) responsive

* COMMENT Prolidase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- skin lesions
- immunological abnormalities
- see figure [[fig:diff]] for details
** Metabolic Derangement
- massive hyperexcretion of a large number of imidodipeptides
  - dipeptides with an N-terminal proline or hydroxyproline
  - particularly glycylproline
- this is due to a deficiency of the exopeptidase prolidase (or
  peptidase D)
** Genetics
- AR PEPD
** Diagnostic Tests
- hyperimidodipeptiduria
- low or absent prolidase activity in haemolysates or in homogenates
  of leukocytes or fibroblasts confirms the diagnosis
** Treatment
- treat skin ulcers w oral ascorbate and manganese (cofactor of prolidase)
