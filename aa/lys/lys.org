* Introduction
- lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan are thought to be degraded
  within the mitochondrion
- initially via separate pathways, which converge into a common 
  pathway at:
  - 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde
    - hydroxylysine catabolism and pipecolic acid pathway of lysine
      catabolism
  - 2-oxoadipic acid
    - tryptophan catabolism
- the major route of lysine catabolism in most tissues is via the
  bifunctional enzyme, 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde synthase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 1)
- small amount of lysine is catabolised via pipecolic acid and the
  peroxisomal key enzyme, pipecolic acid oxidase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 2)
  - this pathway is the major route of lysine catabolism in the
    brain
- source of pipecolic acid is not yet fully understood
  - from lysine and 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde shown
  - microbiome

- hydroxylysine enters the pathway after phosphorylation by
  hydroxylysine kinase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 3)

- 2-Oxoadipic acid is primarily converted to glutaryl-CoA by the
  2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like complex (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 6a)
  since its E1 subunit (DHT-KD1) has a higher substrate affinity for
  2-oxoadipic acid than the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in
  the Krebs cycle (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 6b)

  - 2-Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, however, may serve as an
    alternative route

  - 2-Oxoadipic acid is dehydrogenated and decarboxylated to
    crotonyl-CoA by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 7)
    - tranfers electrons to FAD \to ETC via ETF/ETF-DH
