- initially via separate pathways, which converge into a common 
  pathway at:
  - 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde
    - hydroxylysine catabolism and pipecolic acid pathway of lysine
      catabolism
  - 2-oxoadipic acid
    - tryptophan catabolism
- major route of lysine catabolism in most tissues is via the
  bifunctional enzyme, 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde synthase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 1)
- small amount of lysine is catabolised via pipecolic acid by the
  peroxisomal enzyme, pipecolic acid oxidase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 2)
  - this pathway is the major route of lysine catabolism in the
    brain
- source of pipecolic acid is not yet fully understood
  - from lysine and 2-aminoadipic-6-semialdehyde
  - microbiome
- 2-oxoadipic acid is primarily converted to glutaryl-CoA by the
  ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-like complex (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 6a)
  since its E1 subunit (DHT-KD1) has a higher substrate affinity for
  2-oxoadipic acid than the ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDH) in
  the Krebs cycle (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 6b)
  - KGDH may serve as an alternative route
  - 2-oxoadipic acid is dehydrogenated and decarboxylated to
    crotonyl-CoA by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 7)
    - tranfers electrons to FAD \to ETC via ETF/ETF-DH
- crotonyl-CoA is subsequently converted to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA by
  short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (Figure [[fig:cat]] crotonase, enzyme 8)
  - this enzyme is multispecific and also acts as a crotonase in the
    degradative pathways of valine, isoleucine and short-chain fatty
    acids
- 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is then converted to acetoacetyl-CoA by
  3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 9)
- glutaric acid is derived from the intestinal microbiome, spontaneous
  disintegration of glutaryl-CoA or other sources
  - normally reactivated by succinyl-CoA-dependent conversion via
    succinate-hydroxymethylglutarate CoA transferase to glutaryl-CoA
    (Figure [[fig:cat]] enzyme 10)

- six enzyme deficiencies identified in the degradation of lysine,
  only four \to neurometabolic disorders:
  - antiquitin (Section Vitamin B_6)
  - KGDH - alternative route for lysine catabolism
  - glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase
  - crotonase 

** Cerebral Organic Acidurias
- a group of organic acid disorders present exclusively with
  progressive neurological symptoms of ataxia, epilepsy, myoclonus,
  extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic stroke, and macrocephaly
  - glutaric aciduria
  - 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria
  - \gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria (Section Neurotransmitters)
  - N-acetylaspartic aciduria 
- in all these disorders the pathological compounds that accumulate
  either are odd-chain dicarboxylic acids
  - 2-hydroxyglutarate, 3-hydroxyglutarate, glutarate, N-acetylaspartate
    - sharing the same carbon backbone with the excitatory amino acid
      glutamate (2-amino-glutarate)
  - or neurotransmitters/negative modulators
    - \gamma-hydroxybutyrate

* Glutaric Aciduria Type I
** Clinical Presentation
- differential diagnosis of any infant who has:
  - macrocephaly combined with progressive atrophic changes on MRI or CT and/or
  - complex extrapyramidal syndrome of predominantly dystonia,
    orofacial dyskinesia and dysarthria superimposed on axial hypotonia
- \sim 9 months the majority of untreated patients suffer an acute
  brain injury
  - usually associated with an upper respiratory and/or
    gastrointestinal infection
** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of *glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase* a mitochondrial
  FAD-requiring enzyme
- catalyses the dehydrogenation of glutaryl-CoA and subsequent
  decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA
\ce{glutaryl-CoA + FAD ->[GCDH] crotonyl-CoA + FADH2 + CO2}

- \uparrow glutaryl-CoA \to esterified with carnitine to
  glutarylcarnitine by carnitine acyltransferase
  - \to \uparrow acylcarnitines:free carnitine ratio in plasma and
    urine
  - glutarylcarnitine is excreted, contributing to secondary carnitine
    deficiency
  - often \uparrow urinary excretion of dicarboxylic acids,
    2-oxoglutarate and succinate indicating disturbed mitochondrial
    function

- impaired brain energy metabolism induced by accumulating glutaric
  acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and glutaryl-CoA:
  - glutaryl-CoA inhibits \alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDH)
  - glutaric acid impairs the dicarboxylic acid shuttle between
    astrocytes and neurons
  - 3-hydroxyglutaric acid weakly activates glutamatergic neurotransmission

- weak permeability of the blood-brain barrier for dicarboxylic acids
  - traps these metabolites in the brain compartment

** Genetics
- AR GCDH
- Oji-Cree first nation, incidence of 1 in 300 newborns
  - homozygous for the splice site mutation IVS-1+5 g>t

** Diagnostic Tests
- low excretors: deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and severe
  characteristic neurological disease but with only slight or
  inconsistent elevations of glutaric acid or glutaryl-carnitine
- \uparrow glutaric acid and 3-OH glutaric acid by UOA
  - 3-OH glutaric acid in urine has a high sensitivity including
    - low-excretor phenotype
    - secondary carnitine depletion
- \uparrow glutaryl-carnitine (C5DC)
- \downarrow plasma carnitine
- \Uparrow acylcarnitines:free carnitine in urine and plasma

** Treatment
- early diagnosis key to prevention of acute striatal necrosis and
  neurological sequelae
- emergency treatment during illness
  - \uparrow CHO feeds, carnitine supplementation
  - lysine free amino acids
- oral supplementation w carnitine and riboflavin
- lysine free, tryptophan reduced and arginine enriched amino acid
  mixtures aims to minimise the risk of malnutrition

* L and/or D 2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria
** Clinical Presentation
 - L2 :: progressive neurological disease
   - IQ in adolescence \sim 40-50
 - D2 :: more variable than L2
 - L2 & D2 :: neonatal-onset encephalopathy with severe muscular
   weakness, intractable seizures, respiratory distress, and lack of
   psychomotor development resulting in early death

** Metabolic Derangement
- 2-hydroxyglutarate is a "nonsense metabolite" of glutaric acid
- error in "metabolite repair"
  - L2 :: FAD-linked 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
    - mitochondrial enzyme converts L-2-hydroxyglutarate to
      2-oxoglutarate
    - affected in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD/GA2)
  - D2 :: D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
    - enzyme converts D-2-hydroxyglutarate to 2-oxoglutarate
  - L2 & D2 :: mitochondrial citrate transport protein

** Genetics
 - L2 :: AR L2HGDH
 - D2 :: AR D2HGDH but may be genetically heterogeneous
 - L2 & D2 :: AR SLC25A1

** Diagnostic Tests
- L-2- and D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid cannot be differentiated by
  conventional GC-MS analysis
  - chromatographic separation of these enantiomers can be performed
    using derivatisation with a chiral reagent or a chiral stationary
    phase
    - L2 :: \uparrow L-2-hydroxyglutarate in all fluids
    - D2 :: \uparrow D-2-hydroxyglutarate in all fluids

** Treatment 
- L2 :: riboflavin reported, poor prognosis
- D2 :: none, death in childhood

* N-Acetylaspartic Aciduria
- Canavan disease
** Clinical Presentation
- 2-4 months w progressive neurological disease
- macrocephaly by 1 year

** Metabolic Derangement
- aspartoacylase deficiency

\ce{N-acetyl-L-aspartate + H2O <=>[ASPA] carboxylate + L-aspartate}

- in the brain, aspartoacylase is located in oligodendrocytes
  - hydrolyses NAA which is formed in neurons from L-aspartate and
    L-acetate
- \uparrow NAA results in
  - \downarrow brain acetate levels
  - \downarrow myelin lipid synthesis
  - altered cerebral fluid balance

** Genetics
- AR ASPA

** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow N-acetylaspartic on UOA
  - 100x \uparrow is pathognomonic
- borderline elevation of NAA found in various forms of white matter
  disease
- mutations or enzyme assay to confirm 

** Treatment
- none
