* Introduction
- the three essential BCAAs:leucine, isoleucine and valine , are
  initially catabolised by a common pathway
- the first reaction, occurs primarily in muscle
  - reversible transamination to 2-oxo- (or keto) acids
  - followed by oxidative decarboxylation to coenzyme A (CoA)
    derivatives by branched-chain oxo- (or keto) acid dehydrogenase
    (BCKD)
- the BCAA degradation pathways then diverge
- Leu \to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA \to TCA cycle
- Ile \to acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA
  - propionyl-CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA \to TCA cycle
- Val \to propionyl-CoA
- Met, FFA w odd number of carbons, cholesterol side chains, gut
  bacteria \to propionyl-CoA

- branched-chain organic acidurias or organic acidaemias are a group
  of disorders that result from an abnormality of specific enzymes
  involving the catabolism of BCAAs
- most common: MSUD, IVA, PA, and MMA can present clinically as:


* MSUD, IVA, PA and MMA
** Clinical presentation
- have many clinical and biochemical symptoms in common
- there are three main clinical presentations:
  1) a severe neonatal-onset form of metabolic distress
  2) an acute and intermittent late-onset form
  3) a chronic progressive form presenting as hypotonia, failure to
     thrive, and developmental delay
- NBS has identified asymptomatic forms

*** Severe Neonatal Onset Form
