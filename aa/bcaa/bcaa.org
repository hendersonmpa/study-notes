- the first reaction, occurs primarily in muscle
  - reversible transamination to keto-acids [fn:keto]
  - followed by oxidative decarboxylation to coenzyme A (CoA)
    derivatives by branched-chain keto-acid dehydrogenase
    (BCKD)
- BCAA degradation pathways then diverge
- Leu \to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA \to TCA cycle
- Ile \to acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA
  - propionyl-CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA \to TCA cycle
- Val \to propionyl-CoA
- Met, FFA w odd number of carbons, cholesterol side chains, gut
  bacteria \to propionyl-CoA

- branched-chain organic acidurias result from an abnormality of
  specific enzymes involving the catabolism of BCAAs
- most common are MSUD, IVA, PA, and MMA

[fn:keto] keto is equivalent to 2-oxo

* MSUD, IVA, PA and MMA
** Clinical Presentation
- have many clinical and biochemical symptoms in common
- there are three main clinical presentations:
  1) severe neonatal-onset form of metabolic distress
  2) acute and intermittent late-onset form
  3) chronic progressive form presenting as hypotonia, failure to
     thrive, and developmental delay
- NBS has identified asymptomatic forms

- complication include:
  - renal tubular acidosis
  - skin lesions
  - pancreatitis
  - cardiomyopathy
*** Severe Neonatal Onset Form
- toxic encephalopathy with either ketosis or ketoacidosis
  - hours to weeks after birth
- first signs are poor feeding and drowsiness, followed by unexplained
  progressive coma
- at more advanced stage, neurovegetative dysregulation with
  respiratory distress, hiccups, apnoeas, bradycardia, and hypothermia
  may appear

**** MSUD
- maple syrup or burnt sugar odour
- no pronounced abnormalities on routine chemistry:
  - no hyperammonaemia
  - not dehydrated
  - normal lactate
**** IVA, PA, MMA
- dehydration
- anion gap metabolic acidosis
- ketonuria
- hyperammonaemia in PA and MMA

*** Acute Intermittent Form
- 25% present after a symptom-free period
  - commonly longer than 1 year and sometimes until adolescence or adulthood
- neurological presentation: coma, lethargy
- hepatic: Reye-like syndrome in IVA, PA, MMA
- hematology and immunology: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia

*** Chronic Progressive Form
- GI presentation
- neurological

** Metabolic Derangement
*** MSUD
- *branched-chain \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD)* deficiency
  - E1 or E2 \to MSUD
  - E3 \to dihydrolipamide dehydrogenase deficiency

\ce{keto-isovalerate ->[BCKD] isobutyryl-CoA}

\ce{keto-3-methylvalerate ->[BCKD] 2-methylbutyryl-CoA}

\ce{keto-3-isocaproate ->[BCKD] isovaleryl-CoA}

- marked increases in the branched-chain 2-ketoacids in plasma, urine
  and CSF
- due to the reversibility of the initial transamination step BCAAs
  also accumulate
- smaller amounts of the respective 2-hydroxy acids are formed
- alloisoleucine a diastereomer of isoleucine is found in the blood of
  all patients with classic MSUD and in those with variant forms, at
  least in those still without dietary treatment
- leucine and 2-ketoisocaproic acid appear to be the most neurotoxic

*** IVA
- deficiency of *isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD)*

\ce{isovaleryl-CoA ->[IVD] 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA}

  - intramitochondrial flavoenzyme which transfers electrons to ETF
- accumulation of derivatives of isovaleryl-CoA including:
  - free isovaleric increased in both plasma and urine
  - 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid 
  - N-isovalerylglycine
    - major derivative of isovaleryl-CoA
  - C5-carnitine (isovalerylcarnitine)

*** PA
- deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme *propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC)*
  - one of the five biotin-dependent enzymes
\ce{propionyl-CoA ->[PCC] methymalonyl-CoA}
- \uparrow free propionic acid in blood and urine
- \uparrow derivatives propionylcarnitine (C3-carnitine),
  3-hydroxypropionate and methylcitrate
  - MCA arises by condensation of propionyl-CoA with oxaloacetate
  - catalysed by citrate synthase
- during ketotic episodes, 3-HIVA is formed by condensation of
  propionyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA, followed by chemical reduction
- \uparrow organic acids derived from a variety of intermediates of
  the isoleucine catabolic pathway, such as:
  - tiglic acid, tiglylglycine, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate ,
    3-hydroxybutyrate and propionylglycine, can also be found

*** MMA
- deficiency of *methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM)*
  - adenosylcobalamin (B_12) dependent-enzyme
  - disorders that affect AboCbl formation cause variant
    forms of MMA
\ce{methylmalonyl-CoA ->[MCM + AdoCbl] succinyl-CoA}

- \uparrow methylmalonyl-CoA results in \uparrow methylmalonic acid
  in urine and blood
- secondary inhibition of PCC \to \uparrow PA and PA derivatives

*** Secondary Effects of Elevated Propionyl-CoA
- \uparrow propionylcarnitine \to carnitine deficiency
- \uparrow synthesis of odd numbered LCFAs
- enzyme inhibition by PA leads to:
  - \downarrow glucose - \uparrow insulin 
  - \uparrow lactate - pyruvate dehydrogenase
  - \uparrow ammonia - N-acetylglutamate synthase
  - \uparrow glycine - glycine cleavage system

** Genetics
- MSUD :: AR E1\alpha, E1\beta and E2
- IVA :: AR IVD
- PA :: AR PCCB
- MMA :: AR MUT or cobalamin system (Table [[tab:mma]])
  - mut^{-}(\downarrow activity), mut^0 (zero activity)

[fn:cblc] deficiency of cblC (MMACHC) causes both MMA and homocysteinemia so not "isolated"

* 3-Methylcrotonyl Glycinuria
** Clinical Presentation
- highly variable: neonatal neurological onset with death \to lack of symptoms
** Metabolic Derangement
- *3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC)* deficiency
  - involved in leucine catabolism
  - biotin dependant

\ce{3-methycrotonyl-CoA ->[MCC] 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA}

- MCC is a heteromeric enzyme consisting of
  \alpha-(biotin-containing) and \beta-subunits
- \uparrow 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA \to 3-methylcrotonylglycine and
  3-methylcrotonic acid
- 3-hydroxyisovalerate another major metabolite, is derived
  through the action of a crotonase on 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and the
  subsequent hydrolysis of the CoA-ester
** Genetics
- AR MCCA and MCCB
** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow 3-hydroxyisovalerate 
- \Uparrow 3-methycrotonylglycine
- \Uparrow 3-methylcrotonic acid
- \uparrow C5OH
- without the lactate, methylcitrate, and tiglylglycine found in
  multiple carboxlase deficiency

** Treatment
- glycine and carnitine supplementation

* 3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria
- defective leucine catabolism
- primary 3-methylglutaconic aciduria caused by *3-methylglutaconyl-CoA*
  *hydratase* deficiency (AUH mutations) is very rare
  - \uparrow urine 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric acids
  - \uparrow urine 3-OH-isovaleric differentiates from secondary causes
\ce{3-methylglutaconyl-CoA ->[MGCH] 3-OH-3-methylglutaryl-CoA}
- secondary 3-MGC acidurias are a relatively common finding in a
  number of metabolic disorders, particularly mitochondrial disease
  - phospholipid remodelling
  - mitochondrial membrane
  - unknown etiology
