* Introduction
- the three essential BCAAs:leucine, isoleucine and valine , are
  initially catabolised by a common pathway
- the first reaction, occurs primarily in muscle
  - reversible transamination to 2-oxo- (or keto) acids
  - followed by oxidative decarboxylation to coenzyme A (CoA)
    derivatives by branched-chain oxo- (or keto) acid dehydrogenase
    (BCKD)
- the BCAA degradation pathways then diverge
- Leu \to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA \to TCA cycle
- Ile \to acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA
  - propionyl-CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA \to TCA cycle
- Val \to propionyl-CoA
- Met, FFA w odd number of carbons, cholesterol side chains, gut
  bacteria \to propionyl-CoA

- branched-chain organic acidurias or organic acidaemias are a group
  of disorders that result from an abnormality of specific enzymes
  involving the catabolism of BCAAs
- most common: MSUD, IVA, PA, and MMA can present clinically as:

* MSUD, IVA, PA and MMA
** Clinical Presentation
- have many clinical and biochemical symptoms in common
- there are three main clinical presentations:
  1) a severe neonatal-onset form of metabolic distress
  2) an acute and intermittent late-onset form
  3) a chronic progressive form presenting as hypotonia, failure to
     thrive, and developmental delay
- NBS has identified asymptomatic forms

- complication include:
  - renal tubular acidosis
  - skin lesions
  - pancreatitis
  - cardiomyopathy
*** Severe Neonatal Onset Form
- toxic encephalopathy with either ketosis or ketoacidosis
  - hours to weeks after birth
- first signs are poor feeding and drowsiness, followed by unexplained
  progressive coma
- at more advanced stage, neurovegetative dysregulation with
  respiratory distress, hiccups, apnoeas, bradycardia, and hypothermia
  may appear

**** MSUD
- maple syrup or burnt sugar odor
- no pronounced abnormalities on routine chemistry:
  - no hyperammonaemia
  - not dehydrated
  - normal lactate
**** IVA, PA, MMA
- deydration
- anion gap metabolic acidosis
- ketonuria
- hyperammonaemia in PA and MMA

*** Acute Intermittent Form
- quarter of patients, the disease presents after a symptom-free
  period
  - commonly longer than 1 year and sometimes until adolescence or adulthood
- neurological presentation: coma, lethargy
- hepatic: Reye-like syndrome in IVA, PA, MMA
- hematology and immunology: neutropenia, thrombocytopenia

*** Chronic Progressive Form
- GI presentation
- neurological




** Metabolic Derangement
*** MSUD
- branched-chain \alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) deficiency
  - E1 or E2 \to MSUD
  - E3 \to dihydrolipamide dehydrogenase deficiency

- marked increases in the branched-chain 2-ketoacids in plasma, urine
  and CSF
- due to the reversibility of the initial transamination step BCAAs
  also accumulate
- smaller amounts of the respective 2-hydroxy acids are formed
- alloisoleucine, a diastereomer of isoleucine, is invariably found in
  the blood of all patients with classic MSUD and in those with
  variant forms, at least in those still without dietary treatment
- among the BCAA metabolites, leucine and 2-ketoisocaproic acid appear
  to be the most neurotoxic

*** IVA
- deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD)
  - an intramitochondrialflavoenzyme which transfers electrons to ETF
- accumulation of derivatives of isovaleryl-CoA including:
  - free isovaleric increased in both plasma and urine
  - 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIVA)
  - N-isovalerylglycine
    - major derivative of isovaleryl-CoA
  - isovalerylcarnitine

*** PA
- deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC)
  - one of the 5 biotin-dependent enzymes
- \uparrow free propionic acid in blood and urine
- \uparrow derivatives propionylcarnitine , 3-hydroxypropionate and methylcitrate
  - MCA arises by condensation of propionyl-CoA with oxaloacetate
  - catalysed by citrate synthase
- during ketotic episodes, 3-HIVA is formed by condensation of
  propionyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA, followed by chemical reduction
- \uparrow organic acids derived from a variety of intermediates of
  the isoleucine catabolic pathway, such as:
  - tiglic acid, tiglylglycine, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate ,
    3-hydroxybutyrate and propionylglycine, can also be found

*** MMA
- deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM)
  - B_12 dependent-enzyme
  - disorders that affect adenosylcobalamin formation cause variant
    forms of MMA
- \uparrow methylmalonyl-CoA results in \uparrow methylmalonyic acid
  in urine and blood
- secondary inhibition of PCC \therefore:
  - \uparrow PA and PA derivatives (see [[PA]])

*** Secondary Effects Of Elevated Propionyl-CoA
- \uparrow propionylcarnitine \to carnitine deficiency
- \uparrow synthesis of odd numbered LCFAs
- enzyme inhibition \to
  - \downarrow glucose
  - \uparrow lactate
  - \uparrow ammonia
    \uparrow glycine

** Genetics
- MSUD :: AR, E1\alpha, E1\beta and E2
- IVA :: AR, IVD
- PA :: AR, PCCB
- MMA :: AR, MUT or cobalamin system (Table [[tab:mma]])
  - mut^-(\downarrow activity), mut^0 (zero activity)

| Gene[fn:1] | Protein                     |
|------------+-----------------------------|
| MMUT       | Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase    |
| MCEE       | Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase |
| MMAA       | cblA                        |

[fn:1] deficiency of cblC (MMACHC) causes both MMA and homocysteinemia so not "isolated"

** Diagnostic Tests
- MSUD \to PAA
  - alloisoleucine
- IVA, PA, MMA \to UOA & PAC

** Treatment
- MSUD low BCAA diet
- IVA low protein diet
  - carnitine and glycine \to acylcarnitine & acylglycine
- PA & MMA low protein diet
  - carnitine supplementation
  - MMA test for B_12 response

* 3-Methylcrotonyl Glycinuria
** Clinical Presentation
- highly variable: neonatal neurological onset with death \to lack of symptoms
** Metabolic Derangement
- 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase(3-MCC) deficiency
  - \uparrow 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA \to 3-methylcrotonylglycine
  - 3-methylcrotonic acid
- 3-MCC is a heteromeric enzyme consisting of
  \alpha-(biotin-containing) and \beta-subunits
- 3-hydroxyisovalerate (3-HIVA), another major metabolite, is derived
  through the action of a crotonase on 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA and the
  subsequent hydrolysis of the CoA-ester
** Genetics
- AR, MCCA and MCCB
** Diagnostic Tests
- \Uparrow 3-HIVA
- \Uparrow 3-methycrotonylglycine
- without the lactate, methylcitrate, and tiglylglycine found in
  multiple carboxlase deficiency

** Treatment
- glycine and carnitine supplementation

* 3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria
- primary 3-methylglutaconic aciduria caused by 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA
  hydratase deficiency (AUH mutations) is very rare
- secondary 3-MGC acidurias are a relatively common finding in a
  number of metabolic disorders, particularly mitochondrial disease
