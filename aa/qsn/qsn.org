#+END_EXPORT
- synthesized /de novo/ from glutamate and ammonia by glutamine synthetase
  - the only way to produce glutamine in the human body
  - there is no net absorption from the intestine
- plays a pivotal role in metabolism as constituent, precursor, and
  amino moiety donor for many proteins, purines and pyrimidines,
  NAD^{+}, AMP, amino acids and glucose

** Disorders
- one disorder of glutamine synthesis due to glutamine synthetase deficiency
  - reported in only three patients
  - presented as newborns with epileptic encephalopathy
  - the outcome is very poor
  - not known if early start of glutamine therapy improves clinical
    prognosis
* Serine Metabolism
- synthesized /de novo/ from glycolytic intermediate
  3-phosphoglycerate
  - can also be synthesized from glycine by serine
    hydroxymethyltransferase

#+END_EXPORT
- precursor of a number of compounds that play an essential role in
  neuronal development and function:
  - D-serine
  - glycine
  - cysteine
  - serine phospholipids
  - sphingomyelins
  - cerebrosides
- must be synthesized within the brain because of poor permeability
  across the BBB
  - synthesis is confined to astrocytes
  - shuttle to neuronal cells is performed by a dedicated neutral amino
    acid transporter ASCT1
- major source of THF and of other one-carbon donors that are required
  for the synthesis of purines and thymidine

** Disorders
- four disorders of serine metabolism are known

- three are in biosynthesis:
  - 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency
    - most have severe infantile phenotype called Neu-Laxova syndrome
      - congenital microcephaly, intellectual disability and
        intractable seizures
      - perinatal lethality
    - treatment is oral L-serine
    - supplemented with glycine if unsatisfactory clinical response
  - phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency
    - Neu-Laxova syndrome or milder phenotype
    - treated with oral serine and glycine
  - phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency
    - Neu-Laxova syndrome or milder phenotype

- patients with the severe, infantile form, the treatment is oral
  L-serine, supplemented with glycine in case of unsatisfactory
  clinical response

* Asparagine
- synthesized /de novo/ by asparagine synthetase (ASNS)
  - catalyzes transfer of ammonia from glutamine to aspartic acid via
    a \beta-aspartyl-AMP intermediate

- must be synthesized within the brain because of poor permeability
  across the BBB
  - \therefore asparagine synthesis is essential for the development
    and function of the brain but not of other organs
- ASNS is expressed at low levels in most tissues except the brain
  - there is a brain-specific splice variant
- precursor of the glucogenic amino acid L-aspartate and the
  neurotransmitter D-aspartate
- important role in ammonia detoxification and in asparagine-linked
  protein glycosylation

** Disorders
- one disorder of asparagine synthesis has been reported, due to
  asparagine synthetase deficiency
  - severe psychomotor/intellectual disability, progressive
    microcephaly, limb hypertonia, hyperreflexia and mostly also
    intractable epilepsy
  - death in first year
  - no treatment due to poor BBB permeability for Asp
