* Introduction
** Insulin Secretion
 - glucose is transported into the pancreatic \beta-cell and phosphorylated to G-6-P by glucokinase
   - GCK K_M \sim [glucose] in blood
   - functions as a glucose sensor
 - \uparrow glycolysis \to \uparrow ATP
 - \uparrow ATP/ADP ratio detected by ATP/ADP-sensitive potassium channels (K_{ATP})
   - \to channel closure depolarization of the plasma membrane
   - \to voltage-sensitive Ca^{2+} channel opens
   - influx of extracellular Ca^{2+} stimulates insulin secretion by
     exocytosis from storage granules

 - other mechanisms regulate the release of insulin
   1) transcription factors, such as HNF1A and HNF4A
   2) metabolic factors which modulate the ATP production
      - leucine activation of glutamate dehydrogenase
      - short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
      - monocarboxylate transporter 1
      - mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2
   3) receptors for various hormones and neuropeptides including:
      - somatostatin, insulin, GLP1,GIP, etc

** Insulin Effects
 - activation of insulin receptors:
   - \uparrow glucose utilization
   - \downarrow lipid utilization
   - \uparrow cellular growth
   - translocation of GLUT4 to the PM
 - cerebral cells are poorly insulin-sensitive
   - highly dependent on circulating glucose
     - in hyperinsulinism, there is a significant risk of brain damage
       from neuroglucopenia

* Congenital Hyperinsulinism
- CHI includes all genetic causes of hyperinsulinaemic
  hypoglycaemia due to a primary defect of the pancreatic
  \beta-cell
- CHI can present throughout childhood, most common in infancy
- severe CHI is responsible for recurrent severe hypoglycaemia in neonates
  - delayed diagnosis or inappropriate medical management is responsible for brain damage in about 1/3
- two main histopathological variants of CHI: diffuse and focal
- three forms: transient, syndromic and isolated congenital HI

* Transient and Syndromic HI 
- transient neonatal HI
  - can occur in newborns from diabetic mothers
  - small for gestational age
  - due to perinatal stress such as fetal distress or following birth asphyxia
  - hypoglycaemia can be severe
    - usually resolves within a few days or months
- syndromic HI
  - HI is part of a developmental syndrome
  - hypoglycaemia can be the initial manifestation of a number of
    different syndromes during the neonatal period
    - Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS)
    - CDGs (PMM2-CDG and PMMI-CDG)
    - Kabuki syndrome
    - Sotos syndrome

* Isolated Congenital HI
  - CHI is inherited but occurs primarily as an isolated abnormality
  - hypoglycaemia can reveal the disease in all ages
  - hypoglycaemia occurs both in the fasting and the post-prandial states
  - most neonates (86%) are resistant to treatment with diazoxide

** Metabolic Derangement
 - functional defect of the pancreatic \beta-cells
 - inappropriate secretion of insulin \to hypoglycaemia
   - \downarrow hepatic glucose release from glycogen and gluconeogenesis
   - \uparrow glucose uptake in muscular and fatty tissues
 - CHI is heterogeneous, caused by various defects in regulation of insulin secretion
   - channelopathies affecting the ATP channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations)
   - metabolic defects:
     - enzymes deficiencies: glucokinase, glutamate dehydrogenase, or SCHAD
     - transporter deficiencies: MCT1 and the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2
   - transcription factors impairment, such as HNF1A and HNF4A
   - exceptional cases, defect in the signalling pathway of the insulin
     receptor 

** Genetics
 - estimated incidence of severe CHI is 1 in 50,000 live births
   - in countries with substantial consanguinity it may be as high as 1 in 2,500
 - pattern of inheritance can be dominant or recessive
   - sometimes /de novo/
 - in isolated CHI, the inheritance is:
   - autosomal recessive for ABCC8, KCNJ11 and HADH gene mutations
   - autosomal dominant or /de novo/ for GLUD1, GCK, UCP2, SLC16A1, HNF1A, HNF4A mutations
     - some cases for ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations

** Diagnosis 
 - diagnosis of HI relies on 5 non-essential criteria:
   1. fasting and/or post-prandial hypoglycaemia (<2.5-3 mmol/l)
   2. inappropriate plasma insulin levels and c-peptide at the time of
      hypoglycaemia
      - potentially missed by a single sample because of pulsatile
        secretion of insulin
   3. absent/low blood & urine ketones bodies and non-esterified fatty
      acids (NEFA)
      - in some cases ketones bodies and NEFA are not totally
        suppressed
   4. \uparrow blood glucose \gt 1.7 mmol/l within 30-40 min after
      SC/IM or IV administration of 1 mg glucagon
   5. need for a high glucose infusion rate (GIR) to keep blood
      glucose above 3 mmol/l is characteristic of an insulin related
      hypoglycaemia

 - once HI is established molecular studies to identify a gene
