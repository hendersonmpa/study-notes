** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD Ia, glucose 6 phosphatase-\alpha
- GSD Ib, glucose 6 phosphate transporter
- Disorder of glycogen metabolism and gluconeogenesis
- Failure of glucose dephosphorylation inhibits hepatic glycogen breakdown
- Hyperlactatemia occurs due to lack of gluconeogenesis
  - protective
- hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia due to \uparrow G6P
  - \uparrow G6P \to /de novo/ lipogenesis and flux through pentose phosphate pathway
- G6P transporter required for normal neutrophil function

** Genetics
- AR, 1:100,000, 80% Ia
- GSD Ia: G6PC 
- GSD Ib: SLC37A4
- no genotype phenotype correlation established

** Clinical Presentation
*** Ia and Ib
- severe fasting hypoglycema, lactic acidosis
- hepatomegaly
- hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia
*** Ib
- neutrophil dysfunction
- increased infections

** Diagnostic Tests
- mutation analysis

** Treatment
- generally fatal if untreated
- diet
- liver transplant
- treatment of sequelae
  - hepatic tumors
  - GI disease - IBD in GSD Ib
  - renal disease - glycogen deposition
  - hematological disease
    - anemia
    - coagulopathy
    - infections, GSD Ib
  - cardiovascular disease
  - bone disease

[[file:./figures/gggmetab_hepatic.png]]

** Metabolic Derangement
- Glycogen debrancher enzyme (GDE) deficiency
- has both glucosidase and transferase activity
  - cleaves \alpha-1,4 glucose linkages of the terminal glucose
  - then breaks \alpha-1,6 linkage to remove branch point
- accumulation of abnormal glycogen
- limited glucose release from glycogen
- gluconeogenesis functions normally
** Genetics
- AR, AGL gene
- mutations occur throughout AGL (GSD IIIa)
  - defect in liver and muscle
- two specific mutations in exon 3 (GSD IIIb)
  - liver only 
** Clinical Presentation
- Hepatic glycogenosis and (in most cases) also myopathic
- First year with poor growth, delayed motor milestones and abdominal
  distension
- Fasting hypoglycaemia 
  - Fasting tolerance is usually longer than in GSD I 
- Fasting ketosis is prominent.
- Gluconeogenesis is normal \therefore no fasting hyperlactataemia
- Moderate post-prandial \uparrow lactate
- Hyperlipdaemia
- \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow liver transaminases
- \uparrow CK in myopathic form 
** Diagnostic Tests
- DBE activity in leucocytes
- mutation analysis
** Treatment
- Aim is to maintain normoglycaemia, reduce the hyperlipidaemia and ketosis and
  ensure adequate growth.
- Regular meals and uncooked cornstarch
- Overnight continuous feeding is less commonly needed in GSD III than
  in GSD I
- Long term outcome for individuals with GSD III is generally good
  with survival into adulthood.
* GSD Type IV
** GSD Type IV

#+NAME: fig:hglyc
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.75\textwidth
[[file:./figures/gggmetab_hepatic.png]]

** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD IV is caused by deficiency in glycogen brancher enzyme (GBE).
- GBE transfers short glucosyl chains to form branch points with an
  \alpha-1,6 linkage.
- Deficiency results in an abnormal poorly soluble glycogen with fewer branch points (polyglucosan)
- This abnormal glycogen accumulates in liver, muscle, heart, nervous system and skin.
  - leads to tissue damage.

** Genetics
- AR, GBE1
- Common mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish pop
  - adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD)

** Clinical Presentation

- Multiple phenotypes associated with GBE deficiency
  - Ranges from death in utero to adult presentation

*** Liver Disease
- Progressive liver disease in infancy.
  - Presents in first months of life with:
    - Failure to thrive and hepatomegaly.
  - Cirrhosis develops with eventual end stage liver disease and
    portal hypertension.
  - Death is usual by 5 years of age.
- Non-progressive liver disease in childhood.
  - Present with hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, hypotonia and
    myopathy.
  - Liver disease does not progress, survival into adulthood.

** Clinical Presentation

*** Neuromuscular Disease
- Congenital onset
  - fetal loss in pregnancy,
  - fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) with athrogryposis, hydrops and perinatal death
  - severe congenital myopathy similar to SMA with \pm cardiomyopathy
- Juvenile onset
  - with a myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy
- Adult onset
  - adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD)
  - rarely myopathy

** Diagnostic Tests

- \uparrow transaminases in those with hepatic involvement
- Fasting hypoglycaemia is uncommon except in end stage liver failure
- Liver and muscle histology show swollen hepatocytes that contain
  periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive and diastase resistance
  inclusions and evidence of interstitial fibrosis.
- Enzyme analysis can be undertaken in liver tissue, cultured skin
  fibroblast, peripheral lymphocytes and muscle
- Confirmed by GBE1 mutation analysis.

** Treatment
- Liver transplant is the only treatment for the progressive liver form
- Heart transplant may be considered in those with heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy.
- There is no specific treatment for the other forms of the disease.
* GSD Type VI
** GSD Type VI

#+CAPTION[Hepatic Glycogenoses]:Hepatic Glycogenoses
#+NAME: fig:hglyc
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.75\textwidth
[[file:./figures/gggmetab_hepatic.png]]

** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD VI is caused by deficiency in hepatic glycogen phosphorylase
- Catalyses the release and phosphorylation of terminal glucosyl units
  from glycogen forming glucose-1-phosphate
- Ketosis with or without hypoglycaemia may occur with fasting
- Although plasma lipids may be raised
- In severe variants recurrent hypoglycaemia and post-prandial lactic
  acidosis can occur
** Genetics
- AR, PGYL gene

** Clinical Presentation
- GSD VI is generally a mild disorder often diagnosed due to hepatomegaly.
  - can present with symptomatic ketotic hypoglycaemia and growth retardation
** Diagnostic Tests
- Diagnosis confirmed by mutation analysis or
- Enzyme deficiency in hepatic tissue, erythrocytes, and leukocytes.
- Enzyme activity may not always be reduced in blood and even in liver
  tissue may be difficult to interpret due to residual activity and
  the effect of other factors.
- For example, deficiency of glycogen phosphorylase kinase will cause
  low activity of glycogen phosphorylase.
** Treatment
- No treatment required for asymptomatic children
- Those with growth failure or fasting ketosis benefit from regular
  meals,snacks and uncooked cornstarch.
- The outcome for individuals with GSD VI is generally excellent
  - Catch up growth occurring for those with short stature in childhood.
* GSD Type IX
** GSD Type IX

#+CAPTION[Hepatic Glycogenoses]:Hepatic Glycogenoses
#+NAME: fig:hglyc
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.75\textwidth
[[file:./figures/gggmetab_hepatic.png]]

** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD IX is caused by deficiency in hepatic glycogen phosphorylase kinase (PHK)
- PHK phosphorylates glycogen phosphatase /b/ \to /a/ form
  - inactive /b/ \to  active /a/
- Decreased PHK activity \to \uparrow 
- PHK is homotetramer in which each subunit is itself a tetramer
  - \alpha, \beta, \gamma and \delta subunits.
- The \gamma subunit is catalytic and the other subunits regulatory
- There are tissue specific isoforms of the \alpha and \gamma subunits.
- The \delta subunit, calmodulin, is ubiquitous

** Genetics
| Type | Gene  | Subunit    | Inheritance | Tissue         |
|------+-------+------------+-------------+----------------|
| IXa  | PHKA2 | \alpha2    | XLR         | liver & blood  |
| IXb  | PHKB  | \beta      | AR          | liver & muscle |
| IXc  | PHKG2 | \gamma{}TL | AR          | live           |
| IXd  | PHKA1 | \alpha1    | AR          | muscle         |

** Clinical Presentation
- Usually a benign disorder, with hepatomegaly often detected
  incidentally
- possible short stature, fasting hypoglycaemia and ketosis, with
  raised liver transaminases, cholesterol and triglycerides.
- Blood lactate and uric acid are normal. There is usually resolution
  of signs and symptoms by adulthood.
- GSD IXc can be more severe with an increased risk of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis

** Diagnostic Tests
- Considered in children with unexplained hepatomegaly and in those with ketotic hypoglycaemia.
- PHK can be measured in liver, erythrocytes and leukocytes.
- However, in view of variable tissue expression enzyme assays may be
  difficult to interpret.
- Diagnosis is best achieved by mutation analysis using a DNA panel.
** Treatment
- Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment.
- growth failure or symptomatic hypoglycaemia frequent meals and
  uncooked cornstarch may be used.
- Protein can be increased to 15 to 20% of calories to provide a gluconeogenesis substrate.
- The outcome for most patients is good with resolution of
  hepatomegaly and catch up growth by adulthood.
