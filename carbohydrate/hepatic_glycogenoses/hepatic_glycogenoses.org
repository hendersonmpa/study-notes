  Oa) and fasting hypoglycaemia
- muscle glycogenoses are associated with skeletal and/or
  cardiomyopathy
- clinical phenotypes are extremely heterogeneous

* GSD Type 0
** Clinical Presentation
- ketotic hypoglycema with post-prandial hyperglycemia/uria
- can have poor growth
- no hepatomegaly
** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency in hepatic glycogen synthase (GS2)
- very low liver glycogen
- fasting associated with ketosis
- post-prandial hyperglycemia with moderate hyperlactatemia
  - reduced liver uptake of glucose

** Genetics
- AR GYS2 encodes liver isoform of GS2

** Diagnostic Tests
- mutation analysis
** Treatment 
- avoid fasting
- uncooked cornstarch prior to overnight fast and during infections
* GSD Type I
** Clinical Presentation
*** Ia and Ib
- severe fasting hypoglycema, lactic acidosis
- seizures
- hepatomegaly
- hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia
- doll face, truncal obesity
*** Ib
- neutrophil dysfunction
- increased infections
** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD Ia: glucose 6 phosphatase-\alpha
- GSD Ib: glucose 6 phosphate transporter
- *disorder of glycogen metabolism and gluconeogenesis*
- failure of glucose dephosphorylation inhibits hepatic glycogen breakdown
- hyperlactatemia occurs due to lack of gluconeogenesis
  - protective
- hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia due to \uparrow G6P
  - \uparrow G6P \to /de novo/ lipogenesis and flux through pentose phosphate pathway
- G6P transporter required for normal neutrophil function

** Genetics
- AR 80% Ia
- GSD Ia: G6PC 
- GSD Ib: SLC37A4

** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow glucose
- \uparrow lactate
  - lactic acidosis
- \uparrow triglycerides
- \uparrow uric acid
- molecular testing is diagnostic
  
** Treatment
- generally fatal if untreated
- diet
- liver transplant
- treatment of sequelae
  - hepatic tumors
  - GI disease - IBD in GSD Ib
  - renal disease - glycogen deposition
  - hematological disease
    - anemia
    - coagulopathy
  - infections in GSD Ib
  - cardiovascular disease
  - bone disease

* GSD Type III
** Clinical Presentation
- hepatic glycogenosis and (in most cases) also myopathic
- first year with poor growth, delayed motor milestones and abdominal
  distension
- fasting hypoglycaemia 
  - fasting tolerance is usually longer than in GSD I 
- fasting ketosis is prominent
- gluconeogenesis is normal \therefore no fasting hyperlactataemia
- moderate post-prandial \uparrow lactate
- hyperlipdaemia
- \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow liver transaminases
- \uparrow CK in myopathic form 
** Metabolic Derangement
- glycogen debrancher enzyme (GDE) deficiency
- has both glucosidase and transferase activity
  - cleaves \alpha-1,4 glucose linkages of the terminal glucose
  - then breaks \alpha-1,6 linkage to remove branch point
- accumulation of abnormal glycogen
- limited glucose release from glycogen
- gluconeogenesis functions normally
** Genetics
- AR AGL
** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow glucose
- \uparrow transaminases
- \uparrow cholesterol
- DBE activity in leukocytes
- molecular testing is diagnostic
** Treatment
- aim is to maintain normoglycaemia, reduce the hyperlipidaemia and ketosis and
  ensure adequate growth
- regular meals and uncooked cornstarch
- overnight continuous feeding is less commonly needed in GSD III than
  in GSD I
- long term outcome for individuals with GSD III is generally good
  with survival into adulthood
* GSD Type IV
** Clinical Presentation
- multiple phenotypes associated with GBE deficiency
  - ranges from death /in utero/ to adult presentation

*** Liver Disease
- progressive liver disease in infancy
  - presents in first months of life with:
    - failure to thrive and hepatomegaly
  - cirrhosis develops with eventual end stage liver disease and
    portal hypertension
  - death is usual by 5 years of age
- non-progressive liver disease in childhood.
  - present with hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, hypotonia and
    myopathy
  - liver disease does not progress, survival into adulthood

*** Neuromuscular Disease
- congenital onset
  - fetal loss in pregnancy
  - fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) with athrogryposis, hydrops and perinatal death
  - severe congenital myopathy similar to SMA with \pm cardiomyopathy
- juvenile onset
  - with a myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy
- adult onset
  - adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD)
  - rarely myopathy
** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD IV is caused by deficiency in glycogen brancher enzyme (GBE)
- GBE transfers short glucosyl chains to form branch points with an
  \alpha-1,6 linkage
- deficiency results in an abnormal poorly soluble glycogen with fewer branch points (polyglucosan)
- this abnormal glycogen accumulates in liver, muscle, heart, nervous system and skin
  - leads to tissue damage

** Genetics
- AR, GBE1
- common mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish pop
  - adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD)

** Diagnostic Tests

- \uparrow transaminases in those with hepatic involvement
- fasting hypoglycaemia is uncommon except in end stage liver failure
- liver and muscle histology show swollen hepatocytes that contain
  periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive and diastase resistance
  inclusions and evidence of interstitial fibrosis
- GBE activity in liver tissue, cultured skin fibroblast, peripheral
  lymphocytes and muscle
- confirmed by GBE1 mutation analysis

** Treatment
- liver transplant is the only treatment for the progressive liver form
- heart transplant may be considered in those with heart failure caused by cardiomyopathy
* GSD Type VI
** Clinical Presentation
- GSD VI is generally a mild disorder often diagnosed due to hepatomegaly
  - can present with symptomatic ketotic hypoglycaemia and growth retardation
** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD VI is caused by deficiency in hepatic glycogen phosphorylase
  - catalyses the release and phosphorylation of terminal glucosyl units
    from glycogen forming gluc-1-P
- ketosis with or without hypoglycaemia may occur with fasting
- plasma lipids may be raised
- severe variants recurrent hypoglycaemia and post-prandial lactic
  acidosis can occur
** Genetics
- AR PGYL
** Diagnostic Tests
- \downarrow glucose
- \uparrow lactate
- \uparrow transaminases
- enzyme deficiency in hepatic tissue, erythrocytes, and leukocytes
  - enzyme activity may not always be reduced in blood and even in liver
    tissue may be difficult to interpret due to residual activity and
    the effect of other factors
  - deficiency of glycogen phosphorylase kinase will cause
    low activity of glycogen phosphorylase
- diagnosis confirmed by mutation analysis or
** Treatment
- no treatment required for asymptomatic children
- those with growth failure or fasting ketosis benefit from regular
  meals and uncooked cornstarch
- the outcome for individuals with GSD VI is generally excellent
  - catch up growth occurring for those with short stature in childhood
* GSD Type IX
** Clinical Presentation
- usually a benign disorder with hepatomegaly often detected
  incidentally
  - short stature, fasting hypoglycaemia and ketosis, with
    raised liver transaminases, cholesterol and triglycerides
- blood lactate and uric acid are normal
- usually resolution of signs and symptoms by adulthood
- GSD IXc can be more severe with an increased risk of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis
** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD IX is caused by deficiency in hepatic glycogen phosphorylase kinase (PHK)
- PHK phosphorylates glycogen phosphatase /b/ \to /a/ form
  - inactive /b/ \to  active /a/
- \downarrow PHK activity \to \downarrow G1P release from glycogen
- PHK is homotetramer in which each subunit is itself a tetramer
  - \alpha, \beta, \gamma and \delta subunits
- \gamma subunit is catalytic and the other subunits regulatory
- there are tissue specific isoforms of the \alpha and \gamma subunits
- \delta subunit, calmodulin is ubiquitous

#+NAME: tab:gsdix
| Type | Gene  | Subunit    | Inheritance | Tissue         |
|------+-------+------------+-------------+----------------|
| IXa  | PHKA2 | \alpha2    | XLR         | liver & blood  |
| IXb  | PHKB  | \beta      | AR          | liver & muscle |

| IXd  | PHKA1 | \alpha1    | AR          | muscle         |

** Diagnostic Tests
- fasting hypoglycaemia and ketosis
- \uparrow transaminases, cholesterol and triglycerides
- normal lactate and uric acid
- considered in children with unexplained hepatomegaly and in those
  with ketotic hypoglycaemia
- PHK can be measured in liver, erythrocytes and leukocytes
  - due to variable tissue expression enzyme assays may be difficult
    to interpret
- diagnosis is best achieved by mutation analysis
** Treatment
- asymptomatic patients may not need treatment
- growth failure or symptomatic hypoglycaemia frequent meals and
  uncooked cornstarch may be used
- protein can be increased to 15 to 20% of calories to provide a
  gluconeogenesis substrate
- the outcome for most patients is good with resolution of
  hepatomegaly and catch up growth by adulthood
