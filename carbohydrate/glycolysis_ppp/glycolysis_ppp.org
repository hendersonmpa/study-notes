* Introduction
** Glycolysis 
- Glycolysis is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway
  - converts each molecule of glucose to two of pyruvate.
  - consists of two phases and ten steps.
- The first five steps are the preparatory phase,
  - consumes ATP to convert glucose into two, three-carbon sugar
    phosphate molecules.
- In the other five steps ATP and NADH are produced

** Pentose Phosphate Pathway
*** Oxidative Phase
- glucose 6-P \to NADPH + ribose 5-P
- Glucose 6-P dehydrogenase catalyses first step
- NADPH is for reducing reactions
  - NADPH/NADP^{+} \gt\gt\gt NADH/NAD^{+}
  - NADH is rapidly converted to NAD^{+} in the ETC
*** Non-oxidative Phase
- reversible rxns
- convert glycolytic intermediates to 5 carbon sugars
** Pentose Phosphate Pathway


- Ribose-5-P required for purine and pyrimidine synthesis
- NADPH required for detoxification and synthetic reaction
  - Detoxification
    - Reduction of oxidized glutathione
    - Cytochrome p450 monoxygenases
  - Synthetic reactions
    - FA synthesis
    - Cholesterol 
    - neurotransmitters
    - deoxynucleotide
    - superoxide

* Disorders
** Glycolysis Disorders
- Glycolysis is the most important source of energy in erythrocytes
  and in some types of skeletal muscle fibres

  - \therefore IMD of glycolysis are mainly characterized by hemolytic
    anaemia \pm metabolic myopathy.

- Ten inborn errors of the glycolytic pathway are known,
  - 8 inherited as an autosomal recessive trait
  - X-linked phosphoglycerate kinase and glycerol kinase deficiencies.

- Hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) and pyruvate
  kinase (PKD) deficiencies cause severe haemolytic anaemia.

- Muscle phosphofructokinase (PFKM), aldolase A, triosephosphate
  isomerase (TPI) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) deficiencies are
  characterized by haemolytic anaemia alone or coupled with
  neurological disease and/or myopathy.

** Glycolysis Disorders
- Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), enolase and lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) deficiencies present with a purely myopathic syndrome
  - characterized by exercise induced cramps and myoglobinuria.

- Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is either an isolated condition
  with hypoglycaemia and acidosis or part of a contiguous
  gene deletion where it also associated with congenital adrenal
  hypoplasia and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

- Glucose-6-phosphate can also be formed by the conversion of the
  glycogen derived glucose-1-phosphate, a reaction catalysed by
  phosphoglucomutase (PGM). PGM1 deficiency is a CDG

** PPP Disorders

- Four inborn errors in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are known.
- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked defect
  in the first, irreversible step of the pathway.
  - An exclusively haematological disorder.
- Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency has been described in one patient
  - presented with developmental delay and a slowly progressive leukoencephalopathy.
- Transaldolase (TALDO) deficiency often presents in the neonatal or
  antenatal period with hepatosplenomegaly, \downarrow liver function,
  hepatic fibrosis and anaemia.
- Transketolase (TKT) deficiency presents with short stature,
  developmental delay and congenital heart defects.

** COMMENT PPP Disorders

- Sedoheptulokinase (SHPK) deficiency, a defect related to the PPP has
  been described as an isolated disorder and also as part of a 57-kb
  deletion in nephropathic cystinosis.
- Essential pentosuria is the result of a partial deficiency of L-xylulose reductase (xylitol dehydrogenase) an enzyme of the glucuronic acid pathway.
  - Affected individuals excrete large amounts of L-xylulose in urine.
  - benign disorder that occurs almost exclusively in Jewish people

** Exercising Muscle: Lactate
- Lactate, ammonia and purine compounds are generated by exercising muscle.
- Exercising muscle generates lactic acid from the anaerobic breakdown
  of glycogen to pyruvate
  - \ce{pyruvate \to lactate}
- Lactate enters the circulation and is converted back to pyruvate in the liver.

** Exercising Muscle: ATP

- Some ATP regeneration is provided by glycolytic metabolism of fuels,
  but this is relatively slow
- Most ATP regeneration relys on creatine kinase catalysed transfer of
  phosphate from phosphocreatine.

  - \ce{phosphocreatine + ADP ->[CK] creatine + ATP}

- adenylatekinase transphosphorylates ATP to be regenerated with the formation
  of AMP

  - \ce{2ADP ->[ADK] ATP + AMP}

- AMP deaminase
  - \ce{AMP ->[AMPD] IMP + NH4+}

- IMP degraded to hypoxanthine
- recycled back to AMP in the purine nucleotide cycle.

** Exercising Muscle: Ammonia
- Most ammonia produced by exercising muscle removed by formation of glutamine
  - ultimately excreted as urea

- Some ammonia is released by exercising skeletal muscle directly into the circulation
  - removed with a half-life of 20\pm30 min.
- In resting skeletal muscle ammonia is consumed rather than produced
- ~50% of arterial ammonia can be taken up and metabolized by skeletal muscle.
