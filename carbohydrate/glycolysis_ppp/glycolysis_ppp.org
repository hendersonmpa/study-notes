** Glycolysis 
- Glycolysis is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway
  - converts each molecule of glucose to two of pyruvate.
  - consists of two phases and ten steps.
- The first five steps are the preparatory phase,
  - consumes ATP to convert glucose into two, three-carbon sugar
    phosphate molecules.
- In the other five steps ATP and NADH are produced

** Pentose Phosphate Pathway
- Two phases
*** Oxidative Phase
- glucose 6-P \to NADPH + ribose 5-P
- Glucose 6-P dehydrogenase catalyses first step
- NADPH is for reducing reactions
  - NADPH/NADP^{+} \gt\gt\gt NADH/NAD^{+}
  - NADH is rapidly converted to NAD^{+} in the ETC
*** Non-oxidative Phase
- reversible rxns
- convert glycolytic intermediates to 5 carbon sugars

- Ribose-5-P required for purine and pyrimidine synthesis
- NADPH required for detoxification and synthetic reaction
  - Detoxification
    - Reduction of oxidized glutathione
    - Cytochrome p450 monoxygenases
  - Synthetic reactions
    - FA synthesis
    - Cholesterol 
    - neurotransmitters
    - deoxynucleotide
    - superoxide
* Disorders
** Glycolysis Disorders
- Glycolysis is the most important source of energy in erythrocytes
  and in some types of skeletal muscle fibres

  - *\therefore IMD of glycolysis are mainly characterized by hemolytic*
    *anaemia \pm metabolic myopathy*

- Ten inborn errors of the glycolytic pathway are known,
  - 8 inherited as an autosomal recessive trait
  - X-linked phosphoglycerate kinase and glycerol kinase deficiencies

- Hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) and pyruvate
  kinase (PKD) deficiencies cause severe haemolytic anaemia

- Muscle phosphofructokinase (PFKM), aldolase A, triosephosphate
  isomerase (TPI) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) deficiencies are
  characterized by haemolytic anaemia alone or coupled with
  neurological disease and/or myopathy

- Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), enolase and lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) deficiencies present with a purely myopathic syndrome
  - characterized by exercise induced cramps and myoglobinuria

- Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is either an isolated condition
  with hypoglycaemia and acidosis or part of a contiguous
  gene deletion where it also associated with congenital adrenal
  hypoplasia and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy

- Glucose-6-phosphate can also be formed by the conversion of the
  glycogen derived glucose-1-phosphate

  - a reaction catalysed by
    phosphoglucomutase (PGM). PGM1 deficiency is a CDG

** PPP Disorders

- Four inborn errors in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are known.
- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked defect
  in the first, irreversible step of the pathway.
  - An exclusively haematological disorder.
- Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency has been described in one patient
  - presented with developmental delay and a slowly progressive leukoencephalopathy.
- Transaldolase (TALDO) deficiency often presents in the neonatal or
  antenatal period with hepatosplenomegaly, \downarrow liver function,
  hepatic fibrosis and anaemia.
- Transketolase (TKT) deficiency presents with short stature,
  developmental delay and congenital heart defects.

** PPP Disorders
- Sedoheptulokinase (SHPK) deficiency, a defect related to the PPP has
  been described as an isolated disorder and also as part of a 57-kb
  deletion in nephropathic cystinosis.
- Essential pentosuria is the result of a partial deficiency of L-xylulose reductase (xylitol dehydrogenase) an enzyme of the glucuronic acid pathway.
  - Affected individuals excrete large amounts of L-xylulose in urine.
  - benign disorder that occurs almost exclusively in Jewish people
