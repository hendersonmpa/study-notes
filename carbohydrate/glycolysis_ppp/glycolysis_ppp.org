** Glycolysis 
- glycolysis is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway
  - converts each molecule of glucose to two of pyruvate
  - consists of two phases and ten steps
- first five steps are the preparatory phase
  - consumes ATP to convert glucose into two, three-carbon sugar
    phosphate molecules
    - glyceraldehyde-3-P and dihydroxyacetone-P
- final five steps produce ATP and NADH 

- glucose-6-phosphate can also be formed by the conversion of the
  glycogen derived glucose-1-phosphate
  - a reaction catalysed by phosphoglucomutase (PGM)
  - PGM1 deficiency causes CDG-Ia

** Pentose Phosphate Pathway
- two phases
*** Oxidative Phase
- produces NADPH
- glucose 6-P \to NADPH + ribose 5-P
- glucose 6-P dehydrogenase catalyses first step
- NADPH is a reducing agent
  - oxidized in a reduction rxn
  - NADPH/NADP^{+} \gt\gt\gt NADH/NAD^{+}
  - NADH is rapidly converted to NAD^{+} in the ETC
- NADPH is required for detoxification and synthetic reaction
  - detoxification
    - reduction of oxidized glutathione
    - cytochrome p450 monoxygenases
  - synthetic reactions
    - FA synthesis
    - cholesterol 
    - neurotransmitters
    - deoxynucleotide
    - superoxide
*** Non-Oxidative Phase
- produces ribose-5-P
- reversible rxns
- convert glycolytic intermediates to 5 carbon sugars
- ribose-5-P required for purine and pyrimidine synthesis

* Disorders
** Glycolysis Disorders
- glycolysis is the most important source of energy in erythrocytes
  and in some types of skeletal muscle fibres

  - *\therefore IMD of glycolysis are mainly characterized by hemolytic*
    *anaemia \pm metabolic myopathy*

- ten inborn errors of the glycolytic pathway are known
  - 8 inherited as an autosomal recessive trait
  - X-linked phosphoglycerate kinase and glycerol kinase deficiencies

- severe haemolytic anaemia:
  - hexokinase (HK)
  - glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI)
  - pyruvate kinase (PKD) 
- characterized by haemolytic anaemia \pm neurological disease \pm
  myopathy:
  - muscle phosphofructokinase (PFKM)
  - aldolase A
  - triosephosphate isomerase (TPI)
  - phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)
 
- purely myopathic syndrome characterized by exercise induced cramps
  and myoglobinuria:
  - phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM)
  - enolase
  - lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 

- glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is either an isolated condition
  with hypoglycaemia and acidosis or part of a contiguous gene
  deletion where it also associated with congenital adrenal hypoplasia
  and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy

  - glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency :: an X-linked defect
       in the first irreversible step of the pathway
    - exclusively haematological disorder
  - ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency :: described in one
       patient who presented with developmental delay and a slowly
       progressive leukoencephalopathy
  - transaldolase (TALDO) deficiency :: often presents in the neonatal
       or antenatal period
    - hepatosplenomegaly, \downarrow liver function, hepatic fibrosis
      and anaemia
  - transketolase (TKT) deficiency :: presents with short stature,
       developmental delay and congenital heart defects
