* Introduction
- lactose is the principal carbohydrate in milk
- dairy products are largest exogenous source of galactose
- endogenous galactose production is also significant
- lactose is hydrolysed by lactase \to galactose and glucose
- galactose is then absorbed using a sodium/glucose-galactose cotransporter (SGLT1)
- liver is the major organ responsible for galactose metabolism
 - galactose functions:
   - energy source in pre-weaning infants
   - glycosylation
   - glycolipid synthesis

- UDPgal is used for synthesis of glycoconjugates, including
  glycoproteins, glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans, and their
  subsequent degradation
- all four substrates of GALE: UDP-gal, UDP-glc, UDP-galNAc, and
  UDP-glcNAc are used for glycoconjugate synthesis

- three inborn errors of galactose metabolism are known:
  1) GALT deficiency - classic galactosemia  
  2) GALE deficiency
  3) GALK deficiency

* GALT Deficiency
- AKA: Classic Galactosemia
** Clinical Presentation
 - presents in the neonatal period
   - potentially lethal
 - asymptomatic at birth
 - with feeding:
   - poor weight gain, vomiting, diarrhea
   - hepatocellular damage, lethargy, and hypotonia
 - may progress to gram negative sepsis

** Metabolic Derangement
 - deficient activity of *galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT)*
 - ubiquitous enzyme
 - \uparrow  galatactose
 - \uparrow gal-1-p - pathogenic
 - \uparrow galactitol \to cataracts
 - \uparrow galactonate
 - \downarrow UPD-gal \to disordered glycosylation, glycolipids
 - \downarrow UPD-glc

** Genetics
 - AR GALT
 - p.Q188R
   - ~64% of galactosemic alleles in caucasian pop
   - Irish Travellers 1:430
   - non-functional variant: destabilise UMP-GALT
     - no residual RBC GALT activity
*** Duarte and Los Angles variants
  - Duarte (p.N314D) - 50% RBC GALT enzyme activity
    - not disease causing
    - in linkage disequilibrium w a 4bp promoter deletion 
  - LA (p.N314D) - elevated RBC GALT enzyme activity
    - same electrophoretic pattern
  - p.D314 is the ancestral allele 
  - p.N314 arose early in human evolution

** Diagnostic Tests
 - reducing substances in urine - not specific or sensitive
 - renal tubular damage
 - DBS, plasma, RBC
   - \uparrow gal-1-P
   - \uparrow galactose
   - \uparrow galactitol
 - RBC GALT activity
   - classic galactosemia - \le 1% of controls

** Treatment and Prognosis
 - therapy is life long dietary galactose restriction
   - does not prevent long-term complications
 - endogenous galactose synthesis may be responsible for:
   - cognitive impairment
   - cataracts
   - ovarian insufficiency
 - dairy restrictions
   - bone health 

* GALE Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- ranges from benign \to severe:
  - benign :: GALE deficiency restricted to circulating red and white blood cells
  - severe :: generalized disorder resulting from widespread GALE
              impairment that presents with life-threatening illness
              in the newborn period
- unlike GALT deficiency, even the most severely affected patients
  with GALE deficiency exhibit some residual GALE activity
- severe form is extremely rare

** Metabolic Derangement
- *uridine diphosphate galactose 4â€™-epimerase (GALE)* deficiency
  - GALE deficiency inhibits UDP-glucose regeneration
  - preventing the formation of glu-1-P
  - leading to the accumulation of galactose and gal-1-P
- when exposed to milk accumulate galactose, galactitol, gal-1P, and
  UDPgal in blood
  - may also show abnormal glycosylation of proteins in blood
- RBC GALE activity does not correlate well with that seen in
  other tissues such as lymphoblasts
  - poor at differentiating between peripheral and generalised forms
    of the disease

** Genetics
- AR GALE

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow galactose in serum, DBS, RBC
- \uparrow gal-1-P in serum, DBS, RBC
- may be detected by NBS with \uparrow total galactose or Gal-1P and normal GALT activity
- GALE activity in fresh erythrocytes or other cells
- GALE activity in transformed lymphoblasts
- red cell Gal-1P or urinary galactitol measured with and without dietary galactose
- molecular

** Treatment
- low galactose formula until the diagnosis can be confirmed or excluded
- patients with generalized GALE deficiency should be treated and
  followed much like patients with classic galactosemia
- less stringent dietary galactose restriction may be advisable to
  ensure sufficient exogenous galactose for synthesis of
  galactoproteins and galactolipids
* GALK Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- untreated galactokinase deficiency has been considered largely
  benign except for diet-dependent cataracts and in rare cases pseudotumour cerebri
- symptoms in severe deficiency may include:
  - hypoglycaemia, failure to thrive, microcephaly, intellectual
    disability, and hypercholesterolemia

** Metabolic Derangement
- *galactokinase (GALK)* deficiency
  - lack the ability to phosphorylate galactose
- accumulate galactose and galactitol, but not Gal-1P
- accumulate galactitol in the lens when consuming a high galactose diet
  - causing osmotic swelling, denaturation of proteins, and cataracts

** Genetics
- AR GK1
** Diagnostic Tests
- profound GALK deficiency may be discovered by NBS due to elevated total blood galactose
- enzyme assay of freshly drawn red cells or another cell type
- elevated galactose and galactitol may also be detected in urine if
  the patient is on a high galactose diet

** Treatment
- initial treatment of GALK deficiency involves elimination of milk
  and other high galactose foods from the diet
- cryptic sources of dietary galactose, such as fruits and vegetables,
  are generally allowed
- once a patient is on a galactose-restricted diet urinary levels of
  galactitol should normalize
