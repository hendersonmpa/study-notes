* Classical Galactosemia
 - Caused by deficient activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase
 - ubiquitous enzyme
 - prevalence is 1:16,000-60,000 live births
 - autosomal recessive
   - 336 mutations is the GALT gene described 

 - presents in the neonatal period
   - potentially lethal

 - Therapy is life long dietary galactose restriction
   - does not prevent long-term complications

** Galactose
 - Primary source is dietary lactose
 - Functions
   - energy source in pre-weaning infants
   - glycosylation
   - glycolipid synthesis


 #+CAPTION[lactose]:Lactose is a disaccharide derived from the condensation of galactose and glucose, which form a \beta 1 \to 4 glycosidic linkage.

** GALT gene
 - 9p13, 11 exons, ~4 kb 
 - housekeeping
 - c.563A>G, p.Q188R
   - ~64% of galactosemic alleles in caucasian pop
   - Irish Travellers 1:430
   - Non-functional variant: Destabilise UMP-GALT
     - no residual RBC GALT activity
 - c.855G>T, p.K285N
   - slavic origin?
   - no residual RBC GALT activity

** Duarte and Los Angles variants
 - Duarte (p.N314D) - 50% RBC GALT enzyme activity
 - LA (p.N314D) - elevated RBC GALT enzyme activity
 - Same electrophoretic pattern
 - D is in linkage disequilibrium w a 4bp promoter deletion 
 - p.D314 is the ancestral allele 
 - p.N314 arose early in human evolution


** Biochemical Features
 - \uparrow  Galatactose
 - \uparrow Gal-1-p - pathogenic
 - \uparrow  galactitol - cataracts
 - \uparrow galactonate
 - \downarrow UPD-Gal - disordered glycosylation, glycolipids
 - \downarrow UPD-Glc

** Acute Presentation 
 - asymptomatic at birth
 - with feeding:
   - poor weight gain, vomiting, diarrhea
   - hepatocellular damage, lethargy, and hypotonia
 - May progress to Gram negative sepsis, cataracts

** NBS
 - not universal
   - must be identified early
   - \lt 5 days is ideal

** Spotcheck Method

** Diagnosis
 - reducing substances in urine - not specific or sensitive
 - Gal-1-P, galactose, galactitol in blood or urine
 - RBC Gal-1-P - not specific
 - RBC GALT activity
   - Classic galactosemia - undetectable or 1% of controls

** Therapy and Outcome

*** Therapy
 - life long dietary restriction of galactose.

*** Outcome
 - Endogenous galactose synthesis may be responsible for:
   - Cognitive impairment
   - Ovarian insufficiency
 - Dairy restrictions
   - Bone health 
* Uridine Diphosphate Galactose 4â€™-Epimerase (GALE) Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- GALE deficiency ranges from an apparently benign condition
  associated with GALE deficiency restricted to circulating red and
  white blood cells to a severe generalized disorder resulting from
  widespread GALE impairment that presents with life-threatening
  illness in the newborn period
- unlike GALT deficiency, even the most severely affected patients
  with GALE deficiency exhibit some residual GALE activity, at least
  in some tissues.
- severe form is extremely rare

** Metabolic Derangement
- When exposed to milk accumulate galactose, galactitol, Gal-1P, and
  UDPgal in blood
  - may also show abnormal glycosylation of proteins in blood
- red cell GALE activity does not correlate well with that seen in
  other tissues, such as lymphoblasts,
  - is poor at differentiating between peripheral and generalised forms of the disease

** Genetics
- AR, GALE

** Diagnostic Tests
- may be detected by NBS with \uparrow total galactose or Gal-1P and normal GALT activity
- confirmed by quantitative assay of GALE in freshly erythrocytes or other cells.
- transformed lymphoblasts,
- red cell Gal-1P or urinary galactitol measured while on and off dietary galactose
- molecular

** Treatment
- Low galactose formula until the diagnosis can be confirmed or excluded.
- Once confirmed, patients with generalized GALE deficiency should be
  treated and followed much like patients with classic galactosemia,
- less stringent dietary galactose restriction may be advisable to
  ensure sufficient exogenous galactose for synthesis of galactoproteins and galactolipids.
* Galactokinase (GALK) Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- untreated galactokinase deficiency has been considered largely
  benign except for diet-dependent cataracts and in rare cases pseudotumour cerebri
- Symptoms in severe deficiency may include:
  - hypoglycaemia, failure to thrive, microcephaly, intellectual
    disability, and hypercholesterolemia

** Metabolic Derangement
- lack the ability to phosphorylate galactose
- accumulate galactose and galactitol, but not Gal-1P
- accumulate galactitol in the lens when consuming a high galactose diet
- causing osmotic swelling, denaturation of proteins, and cataracts

** Genetics
- AR, 1/40,000 screened births in Germany
- all mutations associated with clinical GALK deficiency map to GK1.

** Diagnostic Tests
- profound GALK deficiency may be discovered by NBS due to elevated total blood galactose
- enzyme assay of freshly drawn red cells or another cell type
- Elevated galactose and galactitol may also be detected in urine if
  the patient is on a high galactose diet

** Treatment
- Initial treatment of GALK deficiency involves elimination of milk and other high galactose foods from the diet.
- Cryptic sources of dietary galactose, such as fruits and vegetables, are generally allowed.
- Once a patient is on a galactose-restricted diet urinary levels of galactitol should normalize
