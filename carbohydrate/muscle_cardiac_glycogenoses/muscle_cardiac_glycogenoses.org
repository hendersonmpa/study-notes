* Introduction
- muscle predominately utilizes fatty acids for energy when at rest
  - uses blood glucose during sub-maximal exercise
- energy is supplied by glycogenolysis during intense exercise
  - glycogenolysis supplies glucose for anaerobic glycolysis
- muscle disorders are associated with skeletal and/or
  cardiomyopathy
- hepatic glycogenosis are associated with hepatomegaly and fasting
  hypoglycaemia
- clinical phenotypes are extremely heterogeneous

* GSD Type 0
** Clinical Presentation
- muscle fatigue
- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency in *muscle glycogen synthase*
  - ubiquitously expressed
** Genetics
- AR GYS1 encodes muscle isoform of GS
** Diagnostic Tests
- mutation analysis
** Treatment 
- \beta_1-receptor blockage for cardiac protection
* GSD Type II 
- AKA Pompe Disease
** Clinical Presentation
*** Infantile
- first months of life with hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- dysphagia, smooth muscle dysfunction, enlargement of the tongue and
  liver
- most untreated infantile onset patients die from cardiopulmonary
  failure or aspiration pneumonia prior to one year of age 
*** Juvenile
- predominant skeletal muscle dysfunction
  - with motor and respiratory problems, rarely cardiac involvement
  - calf hypertrophy can be present, mimicking Duchenne muscular
    dystrophy in boys
- myopathy and respiratory insufficiency deteriorate gradually, and
  patients may become dependent on a ventilator or wheelchair
*** Adult
- 3rd or 4th decade and affects the trunk and proximal limb muscles
  - mimics inherited limb-girdle muscle dystrophies
- involvement of the diaphragm is frequent
  - acute respiratory failure may be the initial symptom in some patients
- the heart is generally not affected
** Metabolic Derangement
- *acid \alpha-glucosidase* deficiency
- breaks down glycogen in lysosomes
  - \therefore accumulation of glycogen within lysosomes
- different critical thresholds depending on the organ
** Genetics
- AR GAA

** Diagnostic Tests
- characteristic urine oligosaccharide pattern
- acid \alpha-glucosidase enzyme assay
  - classic infantile ~ 1% residual activity
  - juvenile and adult forms \le 30% activity
- skin fibroblasts are best tissue
  - lower biochemical interference from neutral \alpha-glucosidases
- mutation analysis
** Treatment
- recombinant acid \alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA)
  - CHO cells (alglucosidase alfa)
- anti rhGAA IgG antibodies form
  - prior to treatment cross reacting immunological material (CRIM) is measured
    - CRIM -ve patients at high risk of immune response
    - CRIM status used to predict response to treatment
- better outcome if identified by NBS

* GSD Type V
- AKA McArdle Disease
** Clinical Presentation
- exercise intolerance with myalgia and stiffness in exercising muscles
  - relieved by rest
- onset of the disease occurs during childhood
  - diagnosis is frequently missed at an early age
  - affected children are often considered lazy
- myoglobinuria is the major complication, and occurs in about half of
  the patients
- creatine kinase can increase to more than 100,000-1,000,000
  UI/l during episodes of rhabdomyolysis
- risk of acute renal failure
** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD V is caused by deficiency in *muscle glycogen phosphorylase*
- catalyses the release and phosphorylation of terminal glucosyl units
  from glycogen forming glucose-1-phosphate
- three isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase
  - brain/heart, liver and muscle - encoded by different genes
  - GSD V is caused by deficient muscle isoform

** Genetics
- AR PYGM

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow urine myoglobin
- \uparrow plasma CK and uric acid
- ischaemic forearm exercise test was first used by McArdle to
  describe the absence of elevation of lactate during exercise
  - no longer used
- non-ischemic FET has a sensitivity of 100% in McArdle disease
  - see methods section
- ammonia levels should be also assessed in parallel with lactate
  - abnormal increase in ammonia always observed in GSD V
- PYGM gene sequencing

** Treatment
- no pharmacological treatment
- exercise intolerance may be alleviated by:
  - aerobic conditioning programs
  - ingestion of oral sucrose
* LAMP 2 Deficiency 
- AKA: Danon Disease
- deficiency of *lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP 2)*
  - required for lysosomal integrity, pH and catabolism
- rare *X-linked* disorder
- presents after 1st decade
  - cardiomyopathy all cases
  - mild skeletal myopathy and developmental delay ~70%
- muscle biopsy shows glycogen filled vacuoles
- consider cardiac transplantation

* AMPK Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- late adolescence with ventricular pre-excitation
  - predisposing to supraventricular arrhythmias.
- progressive mild to severe cardiac hypertrophy and an increased risk
  of sudden cardiac death
- glycogen storage typically affects only the heart

** Metabolic Derangement
- *AMP activated protein kinase* deficiency
- AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex comprising:
  - a catalytic subunit (\alpha)
  - two regulatory subunits (\beta and \gamma)
- three isoforms of the gamma subunits are known (\gamma1, \gamma2 and \gamma3) with different tissue
  expression
- AMPK controls whole-body glucose homeostasis by regulating metabolism in multiple peripheral tissues, such as
  skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissues, and pancreatic \beta-cells
- activated \uparrow AMP/ATP ratio
- stimulates glucose uptake and lipid oxidation to produce energy
- inhibits energy-consuming processes including glucose and lipid production
** Genetics
- PRKAG2 encodes the \gamma-subunit of AMPK
- mutations in the \gamma2-subunit of AMPK are transmitted as an
  autosomal dominant trait with full penetrance

** Diagnosis & Treatment
- differential diagnosis includes Pompe, Danon (LAMP2) and Fabry diseases
- diagnosis is based on echocardiography and molecular genetics
- treatment includes a pacemaker/defibrillator and heart transplant
