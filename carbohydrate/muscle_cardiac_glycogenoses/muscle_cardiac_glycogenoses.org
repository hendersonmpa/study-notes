* Introduction
- muscle predominately utilizes fatty acids for energy when at rest
  - uses blood glucose during sub-maximal exercise.
- energy is supplied by glycogenolysis during intense exercise.
  - glycogenolysis supplies glucose for anaerobic glycolysis
- hepatic glycogenosis generally cause hepatomegaly (apart from GSD
  Oa) and fasting hypoglycaemia
- muscle disorders are associated with skeletal and/or
  cardiomyopathy
- clinical phenotypes are extremely heterogeneous

* GSD Type 0
** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency in muscle glycogen synthase
  - ubiquitously expressed
** Genetics
- AR, GYS1 encodes muscle isoform of GS
** Clinical Presentation
- muscle fatigue
- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
** Diagnostic Tests
- mutation analysis
** Treatment 
- \beta_1-receptor blockage for cardiac protection
* GSD Type II (Pompe)
** Metabolic Derangement
- acid \alpha-glucosidase deficiency
- accumulation of glycogen within the lysosomes
- different critical thresholds depending on the organ
** Genetics
- AR, AGL gene
- 200 mutations have been reported in GAA
  - ~ 75% of these being pathogenic mutations (www.pompecenter.nl)
- some genotype-phenotype correlation
  - severe mutations (such as del exon18) associated with the infantile form
  - ›leaky‹ mutations associated with the adult variant
- c.-32-13T>G is the most common mutation in adults and children with
  a slowly progressive course
  - approximately 80% of Caucasian patients
** Clinical Presentation
*** Infantile
- first months of life with hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- also dysphagia, smooth muscle dysfunction, enlargement of the tongue
  and liver
- most untreated infantile onset patients die from cardiopulmonary
  failure or aspiration pneumonia prior to one year of age 
*** Juvenile
- predominant skeletal muscle dysfunction
  - with motor and respiratory problems, rarely cardiac involvement
  - Calf hypertrophy can be present, mimicking Duchenne muscular dystrophy in boys
- myopathy and respiratory insufficiency deteriorate gradually, and patients may become dependent on a ventilator or wheelchair
*** Adult
- 3rd or 4th decade and affects the trunk and proximal limb muscles
  - mimics inherited limb-girdle muscle dystrophies
- involvement of the diaphragm is frequent
  - acute respiratory failure may be the initial symptom in some patients
- the heart is generally not affected
** Diagnostic Tests
- acid \alpha-glucosidase enzyme assay
  - classic infantile ~ 1% residual activity
  - Children and Adults \le 30% activity
- skin fibroblasts are best tissue
  - Lower biochemical interference (neutral \alpha-glucosidases)
- mutation analysis
** Treatment
- recombinant acid \alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA)
  - CHO cells (alglucosidase alfa)
- anti rhGAA IgG antibodies form
- 1/3 of ERT treated were ventilator free
- better outcome if identified by NBS

* GSD Type V
** Metabolic Derangement
- GSD V is caused by deficiency in muscle glycogen phosphorylase
- catalyses the release and phosphorylation of terminal glucosyl units
  from glycogen forming glucose-1-phosphate
- there are three isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase: brain/heart
  liver and muscle, all encoded by different genes
- GSD V is caused by deficient myophosphorylase activity

** Genetics
- AR, PYGM
- \gt 100 known pathogenic mutations
- p.R50X mutation, most common in Caucasians
  - 81% of the alleles in British patients
  - 63% of alleles in US patients
- No genotype-phenotype correlations have been detected
- ACE polymorphism may be a phenotype modulator

** Clinical Presentation
- exercise intolerance with myalgia and stiffness in exercising muscles
  - relieved by rest
- onset of the disease occurs during childhood
  - diagnosis is frequently missed at an early age
  - affected children are often considered lazy
- myoglobinuria is the major complication, and occurs in about half of
  the patients
- creatine kinase (CK) can increase to more than 100,000-1,000,000
  UI/l during episodes of rhabdomyolysis
- risk of acute renal failure

** Diagnostic Tests
- ischaemic forearm exercise test (IFET) was first used by McArdle to
  describe the absence of elevation of lactate during exercise
  - *Should not be used*
- non-ischemic FET has a sensitivity of 100% in McArdle’s disease
- ammonia levels should be also assessed in parallel with lactate
  -  an abnormal increase in ammonia always observed in GSD V
- PYGM gene sequencing

** Treatment
- no pharmacological treatment
- exercise intolerance may be alleviated by:
  - aerobic conditioning programs
  - ingestion of oral sucrose
* LAMP 2 Deficiency (Danon Disease)
- Danon disease is a rare X-linked disorder
- caused by a primary deficiency of lysosomal-associated membrane
  protein 2 (LAMP2)
- presents after 1st decade
  - cardiomyopathy all cases
  - mild skeletal myopathy and developmental delay 70%
- muscle biopsy shows glycogen filled vacuoles
- consider cardiac transplantation

* AMPK Deficiency
- AMPK controls whole-body glucose homeostasis by regulating metabolism in multiple peripheral tissues, such as
  skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissues, and pancreatic \beta-cells
- activated \uparrow AMP/ATP ratio
- stimulates glucose uptake and lipid oxidation to produce energy
- inhibits energy-consuming processes including glucose and lipid production.

** Metabolic Derangement
- AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex comprising:
  - a catalytic subunit (\alpha)
  - two regulatory subunits (\beta and \gamma)
- three isoforms of the gamma subunits are known (\gamma1, \gamma2 and \gamma3) with different tissue
  expression

** Genetics
- PRKAG2 gene coding for the \gamma-subunit of AMPK is located on chromosome 7q36
- mutations in the \gamma2-subunit of AMPK are transmitted as an
  autosomal dominant trait with full penetrance

** Diagnosis & Treatment
- the differential diagnosis includes Pompe, Danon (LAMP2) and Fabry diseases
- diagnosis, if clinically suspected, is based on ECG,
  echocardiography and molecular genetics
- treatment includes a pacemaker/defibrillator and heart transplant
