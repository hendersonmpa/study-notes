* Introduction
** Glucose Transporters
 - glucose is hydrophilic \therefore cannot easily cross cell membrane
 - transporters exist in almost all cell types
 - glucose transporter proteins can be divided into two groups:
   1. Sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs)
      - symporter systems, active transporters encoded by members of
	the SLC5 gene family
      - couple sugar transport to the electrochemical gradient of sodium
      - transport glucose \uparrow [gradient]
   2. Facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs)
      - uniporter systems, passive transporters encoded by members of the SLC2 gene family
      - transport glucose \downarrow [gradient]

** Congenital Defects of Glucose Transporters
 - Five congenital defects of monosaccharide transporters
 - Their clinical picture depends on tissue-specific expression and
   substrate specificity of the affected transporter

   1. SGLT1 : Congenital Glucose/Galactose Malabsorption
   2. SGLT2 : Renal Glucosuria
   3. GLUT1 : Glucose Transporter-1 Deficiency
   4. GLUT2 : Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome
   5. GLUT10 : Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome

* Congenital Glucose/Galactose Malabsorption (SGLT1 Deficiency )

- SGLT1 is a high-affinity, low-capacity sodium-dependent transporter
  of the two monosaccharides, at the brush border of enterocytes

- SGLT1 deficiency \to intestinal glucose-galactose malabsorption
- GGM is a rare autosomal recessive disorder

- presents with severe osmotic diarrhoea and dehydration soon after a
  normal birth and pregnancy
  - patients develop severe hypertonic dehydration, often with fever
  - patients die from hypovolaemic shock

- Treatement is a glucose and galactose free diet

* Renal Glucosuria (SGLT2 Deficiency)
- SGLT2 is the major co-transporter involved in glucose reabsorption in
  the kidney
- SGLT2 deficiency results in isolated renal glucosuria
  - a harmless renal transport defect characterised by:
    - glucosuria
    - normal blood glucose concentrations
    - absence of any other signs of renal tubular dysfunction

* Glucose Transporter-1 Deficiency (GLUT1 Deficiency)
- GLUT1 is a membrane-spanning, glycosylated protein that facilitates
  glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier
  - low CSF glucose concentration (hypoglycorrhachia)

- clinical symptoms include: microcephaly, epileptic encephalopathies,
  paroxysmal movement disorders, tremor
- haemolytic anaemia has also been observed

- AD and AR inheritance described, SLC2A1

- GLUT1D should be suspected in any child with a CSF glucose
  concentration \lt 2.5 mmol/L 
  - normal \gt 3.3 mmol/L

- CSF to blood glucose ratio \lt 0.5 
  - normal \gt 0.6
  - in the absence of hypoglycaemia or a CNS infection is diagnostic.
- ketogenic diet is used in treatment

* Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome (GLUT2 Deficiency )

- GLUT2 is a high-K_M monosaccharide carrier 
  - located in hepatocytes
  - basolateral membrane of cells in the proximal tubule
  - pancreatic \beta-cells

- typically presents with a combination of increased hepatic
  glycogen storage, generalised renal tubular dysfunction, severe glucosuria

- in FBS GLUT2 acts as a malfunctioning glucose sensor:
  - in the fasted state, [glucose] and [G-6-P] are inappropriately \uparrow in hepatocytes
  - stimulates glycogen synthesis, inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
  - predisposes to hypoglycaemia and hepatic glycogen accumulation

- very rare AR, SLC2A2

- diagnosis suggested by the characteristic combination of an altered
  glucose homeostasis, hepatic glycogen accumulation, and the typical
  features of a Fanconi-type tubulopathy

- elevated biotinidase activity in serum has been found to be a useful
  screening test for hepatic glycogen storage disorders including FBS

- only symptomatic treatment is available

* Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (GLUT10 Deficiency)

- GLUT10 function not entirely clear:
  - localizes to mitochondria of smooth muscle and insulin-stimulated adipocytes
  - facilitates transport of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the
    oxidized form of vitamin C, into mitochondria

- GLUT10 deficiency is characterised by hyperelastic connective tissue
  and generalised tortuosity and elongation of all major arteries
  including the aorta

- presents with acute infarction owing to ischaemic stroke or an
  increased risk of thromboses
- Aortic regurgitation and multiple pulmonary artery stenoses are
  typical intrathoracic manifestations
- closely resembles a connective tissue disorder in presentation

- rare, AR GLUT10 (SLC2A10)
- Echocardiography, angiography, and/or CT scan are important to demonstrate vascular changes.
- Diagnosis is based on molecular genetic methods
