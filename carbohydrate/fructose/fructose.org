* Introduction
- fructose is mainly metabolised in the liver, renal cortex and small
  intestinal mucosa (Figure [[fig:ms]])
- pathway composed of fructokinase, aldolase B and triokinase
- aldolase B is also involved in the glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway

* Essential Fructosuria
** Clinical Presentation
- rare non-disease
- incidental finding due to positive urine reducing substances 
** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency in *fructokinase*
- 10-20% of ingested fructose is excreted in urine
- remainder is slowly metabolised in adipose tissue and muscle
** Genetics
- AR KHK
** Diagnosis and Treatment
- \uparrow reducing substances in urine
- glucose oxidase negative
- fructosuria is dependant on fructose intake
- no treatment required
- prognosis is excellent

* Hereditary Fructose Intolerance
** Clinical Presentation
- perfectly healthy as long as they do not ingest food containing
  fructose, sucrose and/or sorbitol
- no metabolic derangement occurs during breast-feeding
- younger the child and the higher the dietary fructose load the more
  severe the reaction
- first symptoms appear with the intake of fruits and vegetables or
  fructose containing formula
  - gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, restlessness,
    pallor, sweating, trembling, lethargy
  - coma and convulsions
- acute liver failure and renal proximal tubule damage
- hypoglycaemia after fructose ingestion is short-lived and can be
  easily missed or masked by concomitant glucose intake
- food aversions form
- approximately half of all adults with HFI are free of dental caries
- affected subjects may remain undiagnosed and still have a normal
  life span

** Metabolic Derangement
- HFI is caused by *aldolase B* deficiency
  - second enzyme of the fructose pathway
  - splits fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P) into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHA-P) and glyceraldehyde (GAH)
- high activity of fructokinase after intake of fructose results in
  accumulation of F-1-P and trapping of phosphate
- two major effects:
  1. inhibition of glucose production by blockage of gluconeogenesis
     (inhibition of aldolase A) and glycogenolysis (inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase A)
     - induces a rapid drop in blood glucose
  2. overutilization and diminished regeneration of ATP
     - depletion of ATP results in an increased production of uric acid
     - release of magnesium
     - impaired protein synthesis and ultrastructural lesions \to
       hepatic and renal dysfunction
- glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are not impaired in the fasted state
  in HFI patients due to activity of aldolase A

** Genetics
- AR ALDOB

** Diagnostic Testing
- nutritional history
- renal tubule damage
  - \uparrow glucose in urine
  - \uparrow albumin in urine
  - \uparrow amino acids in urine
- response to fructose withdrawal
- first tier molecular diagnosis
- second tier (no mutations) \to enzymatic
- liver biopsy Aldo B activity
  - false low Aldo B secondary to liver damage

** Treatment
- acute intoxication may require treatment with fresh frozen plasma
- remove fructose, sucrose and sorbitol from diet
- prognosis on diet is excellent with normal growth, intelligence and
  life span

* Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase Deficiency
** Clinical Presentation
- 50% present in the first 1-4 days of life
  - severe hyperventilation
    - lactic acidosis
    - hypoglycaemia
- later irritability, apnoeic spells, tachycardia, muscle hypotonia, hepatomegaly 
- chronic ingestion of fructose does not lead to gastrointestinal symptoms
  - no aversion to sweet foods or failure to thrive, and only rarely \downarrow liver function

** Metabolic Derangement
- deficiency of *hepatic FBPase* a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis
  - impairs the formation of glucose from all gluconeogenic precursors including dietary fructose
- normoglycaemia in patients is dependent on glucose and galactose
  intake and degradation of hepatic glycogen
- hypoglycaemia occurs when glycogen reserves are limited (newborns, fasting)
- accumulation of the gluconeogenic substrates lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and glycerol
** Genetics
- AR FBP1

** Diagnosis
- plasma during acute episodes
  - \Uparrow lactate
    - \therefore hyperalaninaemia
  - \downarrow pH
  - \Uparrow lactate/pyruvate ratio
  - \uparrow glycerol which may mimic hypertriglyceridaemia
    - glycerol based trigs assays
  - glucagon-resistant hypoglycaemia
  - \uparrow free fatty acids and uric acid
- urinary analysis reveals
  - \uparrow lactate, alanine, glycerol
  - in most cases, ketones and glycerol-3-phosphate

- molecular analysis on DNA from peripheral leukocytes
- if no mutations found
  - enzymatic activity in a liver biopsy
  - the residual activity may vary from 0 to 30% of normal

*** Differential Diagnosis
 - other disturbances in gluconeogenesis and pyruvate oxidation should be considered:
   1) pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency characterised by a low
      lactate/pyruvate ratio, absence of hypoglycaemia and aggravation
      of lactic acidosis by glucose infusion
   2) pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
   3) respiratory chain disorders
   4) GSD Ia presenting with the same metabolic profile
      - fasting hypoglycaemia and lactic acidosis and hepato-nephromegaly, hyperlipidaemia, and hyperuricaemia
   5) fatty acid oxidation defects presenting with fasting hypoketotic hypoglycaemia and hyperlactataemia

** Treatment
- acute life-threatening episodes should be treated with an IV bolus
  of 20% glucose
- followed by a continuous infusion of glucose and bicarbonate to
  control hypoglycaemia and acidosis
- maintenance therapy should be aimed at avoiding fasting,
  particularly during febrile episodes
  - slowly absorbed carbohydrates (uncooked starch), and a gastric
    drip, if necessary
- absence of any triggering effects leading to metabolic
  decompensation, individuals with FBPase deficiency are healthy and
  no carbohydrate supplements are needed
