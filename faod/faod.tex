\section{Fatty Acid Oxidation}
\label{sec:org3042910}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org3464f69}
\begin{itemize}
\item fatty acids are usually straight aliphatic chains with a methyl
group at one end (\(\omega\)-carbon) and a carboxyl group and the other
end
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fatty Acid Nomenclature}
\label{sec:orgb097c8c}
\begin{itemize}
\item non-systematic historical names most commonly used
\begin{description}
\item[{Palmitic acid}] discovered in palm oil
\item[{Stearic acid}] from the Greek word "stear", which means tallow
\item[{Oleic acid}] oleic means related to, or derived from, olive oil
\end{description}
\item position of a double bond is designated by the number of the carbon in the double bond that is closest to the carboxyl group
\end{itemize}


\definesubmol{x}{-[1,.6]-[7,.6]}
\definesubmol{y}{-[7,.6]-[1,.6]}
\definesubmol{d}{=[0,.6](-[7,0.25,,,draw=none]\scriptstyle\color{red}9)-[1,.6]}
\definesubmol{e}{!x!x!x!x!d!y!y!y}
\chemname{\chemfig{\omega{}(-[3,0.25,,,draw=none]\scriptstyle\color{red}18)!e(-[2,0.25,,,draw=none]\scriptstyle\color{red}2)-[7,.6]COOH}}{\small Oleic acid 18:1,\Delta{}$^9$}
\begin{itemize}
\item oleic acid - 18:1,\(\Delta^{\text{9}}\)
\begin{itemize}
\item 18:1 - 18 carbons and 1 double bond
\item \(\Delta^{\text{9}}\) - double bond between 9th and 10th carbon
\begin{itemize}
\item also 18:1(9)
\item distance from \(\omega\) methyl group, \(\omega\)-9
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item fatty acid chain length:
\begin{description}
\item[{very long-chain}] > C20
\item[{long-chain}] C12-C20
\item[{medium-chain}] C6-C12
\item[{short-chain}] C4
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mitochondrial \(\beta\)-oxidation}
\label{sec:org2307b5c}
\begin{itemize}
\item long chain fatty acids released from adipose tissue triacylglycerol
stores during periods of increased fuel demand or fasting
\item \(\downarrow\) insulin, \(\uparrow\) glucagon \(\to\) \(\uparrow\) lipolysis
\begin{itemize}
\item dietary lipids
\item triacylglycerols synthesis in the liver
\item palmitate (C16:0), oleate (C18:1, \(\Delta^{\text{9}}\)) and stearate (C18:0)
\end{itemize}
\item FA transported to tissue bound to albumin
\item energy derived from oxidation of FA to acetyl-CoA in \(\beta\)-oxidation
\item acetyl-CoA is oxidized in the TCA cycle or converted to ketone bodies in the liver

characterized to transport monocarboxylates and short chain fatty
acids (MCT1-4), thyroid hormones (MCT8-10) and aromatic amino
acids (MCT10)

membranes

\end{itemize}
\item the hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic
\begin{itemize}
\item ketone bodies can be synthesised
\begin{itemize}
\item medium-or short-chain FAODs or if there is high residual enzyme activity
\item plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or the plasma free fatty acid concentrations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item inhibitory effects of metabolites on pyruvate metabolism
\end{itemize}
\item moderate hyperuricaemia - frequent finding during acute attacks
\item secondary hyperprolinaemia occurs in some babies with MAD deficiency
\item accumulating long-chain acylcarnitines may be responsible for
arrhythmias and may interfere with surfactant metabolism
\item in LCHAD and MTP deficiencies, long chain hydroxy-acylcarnitine
concentrations correlate with the severity of retinopathy and may
cause both this and the peripheral neuropathy

\subsection{Routine Biochemistry}
\label{sec:orgdd46d7d}
\begin{itemize}
\item glucose
\item ketones
\item lactate
\item ammonia
\item uric acid
\item creatine kinase (CK)
\item Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) \& Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platlets (HELLP)

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Fasting Hypoglycaemia  in FAODs}
\label{sec:org27bdc81}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
\begin{itemize}
\item primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic
\begin{itemize}
\item Ketone bodies can be synthesised (medium-or short-chain FAODs or
if there is high residual enzyme activity)
\item plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or
the plasma free fatty acid concentrations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Randle Cycle}
\label{sec:org11c3ba1}
\begin{itemize}
\item fasted state:
\begin{itemize}
\item fatty acids inhibit glucose oxidation at pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH)
\item long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives directly inhibit glucokinase
\end{itemize}
\item fed state:
\begin{itemize}
\item insulin inhibits lipolysis
\item malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT1
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) esterification of FA
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inhibition of Glucose Utilization by Fatty Acids}
\label{sec:orgfdc7baf}

\caption{\label{fig:org55d6bf4}
Inhibition of Glucose Utilization by FA}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item extent of inhibition is graded and most severe at the level of
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and less severe at the level of
6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) and glucose uptake
\item PDH inhibition is caused by acetyl-CoA and NADH accumulation
resulting from fatty acid oxidation, whereas PFK inhibition results
from citrate accumulation in the cytosol. The mechanism of
inhibition of glucose uptake is not clear
\begin{itemize}
\item reroute glucose toward glycogen synthesis and pyruvate
to anaplerosis and/or gluconeogenesis
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inhibition of Fatty Acid Utilization by Glucose}
\label{sec:org30dbc34}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./faod_routine_testing/figures/FAO_inhibition.png}
\caption{\label{fig:org07f1a7c}
Inhibition of FA Utilization by Glucose}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item mechanism is mediated by malonyl-CoA, the concentration of which
depends on ACC activity and which inhibits the entry of long-chain
fatty acyl-CoA into mitochondria
\item reroutes fatty acids toward esterification
\item extrahepatic tissues, the effect of glucose is stimulated by
insulin
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lactic Acidemia in FAODs}
\label{sec:org6dec8e8}
\begin{itemize}
\item lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (VLCAD, LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
\item long-chain acyl-CoA esters have been found to inhibit a large
variety of enzymes including the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier
\begin{itemize}
\item mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the exchange of intra- and
extra-mitochondrial adenine nucleotides
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{in vivo} the ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the transport of ATP
synthesized in the mitochondrion by the F\(_{\text{1}}\) F\(_{\text{0}}\)-ATPase reaction to the
extra-mitochondrial space in exchange for cytosolic ADP
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) intra-mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and \(\downarrow\) oxidation of
NADH \(\to\) NAD\(^{\text{+}}\)
\item \(\uparrow\) ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD\(^{\text{+}}\) ratios will activate PDK
\item PDK inactivates PDH by phosphorylation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects,
\begin{itemize}
\item with normal or low glutamine concentrations;
\item decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate
\end{itemize}
\item influence of metabolic disorders on function of urea cycle leading
to secondary hyperammonemia
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Moderate hyperuricaemia and elevated CK}
\label{sec:org0087e65}
\begin{itemize}
\item seen in acute attacks 
\begin{itemize}
\item association suggests that the mechanism is a breakdown of
cells, particularly muscle
\item ATP depletion \(\to\) \(\downarrow\) Na/K-ATPase
\end{itemize}
\item release of CK
\item uric acid excess is the product of nucleic acid and nucleotide catabolism.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AFLP/HELLP}
\label{sec:org409ab30}
\begin{itemize}
\item mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
carrying an affected fetus
\item woman whose affected fetus has the Glu474Gln mutation on one or
both alleles of the \(\alpha\)-subunit of the trifunctional protein is
likely to have acute fatty liver of pregnancy or the HELLP syndrome 
\begin{itemize}
\item long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl metabolites produced by the fetus or
placenta accumulate in the mother and are highly toxic to the liver
\item exaggerated by the decreased metabolic utilization of fatty acids
during pregnancy
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
