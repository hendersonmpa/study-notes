(\(\omega\)-carbon) and a carboxyl group and the other end.

\subsubsection{Fatty Acid Nomenclature}
\label{sec:org2611a5c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-systematic historical names most commonly used.
\begin{description}
\item[{Palmitic acid}] discovered in palm oil
\item[{Stearic acid}] from the Greek word "stear", which means tallow.
\item[{Oleic acid}] oleic means related to, or derived from, olive oil
\end{description}
\item The position of a double bond is designated by the number of the carbon in the double bond that is closest to the carboxyl group
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item 18 carbons
\item 1 double bond
\item \(\Delta^{\text{9}}\), double bond between 9th and 10th carbon.
\item Also 18:1(9)

\item[{Long-chain}] C12-C20
\item[{Medium-chain}] C6-C12
\item[{Short-chain}] C4
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Fatty Acids as an Energy Source}
\label{sec:orgbffc9bd}

\begin{itemize}
\item Long chain fatty acids released from adipose tissue triacylglycerol
stores during periods of increased fuel demand or fasting.

characterized to transport monocarboxylates and short chain fatty
acids (MCT1-4), thyroid hormones (MCT8-10) and aromatic amino
acids (MCT10)

\item MCT1 mediates the movement of lactate and pyruvate across cell
membranes.
\begin{itemize}
\item erythrocytes, muscle, intestine, liver and kidney

dehydrogenases of \(\beta\)-oxidation
\item Defects in ETF or ETFQO \(\to\)
\item GAII less often, a result of defects of riboflavin transport or
metabolism
\item ETF and ETFQO deficiencies \(\to\) wide range of clinical severity.
\item Severely affected patients present in the first few days of life
\begin{itemize}
\item hypoglycaemia, hyperammonaemia and acidosis
\item hypotonia and hepatomegaly.
\end{itemize}
\item There is usually an odour of sweaty feet similar to that in isovaleric acidaemia.

\begin{itemize}
\item Large cystic kidneys, hypospadias and neuronal migration defects and facial dysmorphism
\begin{itemize}
\item low set ears, high forehead and midfacial hypoplasia.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item The malformations resemble those seen in CPT II deficiency but the pathogenesis is unknown.
\item Most patients with neonatal presentation die within a week of birth

hypoventilation or an inability to lift the chin off the chest.
\end{itemize}
\item Weakness can worsen rapidly during infection or pregnancy, myoglobinuria is rare.
\begin{itemize}
\item Many milder defects respond to riboflavin

\subsection{Metabolic Derangement}
\label{sec:orgf410ecd}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
\begin{itemize}
\item primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
\item hepatic glucose output is also reduced under some conditions.
\end{itemize}
\item The hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic.
\begin{itemize}
\item Ketone bodies can be synthesised
\begin{itemize}
\item medium-or short-chain FAODs or if there is high residual enzyme activity
\item plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or the plasma free fatty acid concentrations.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects
\begin{itemize}
\item with normal or low glutamine concentrations
\item decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate
\end{itemize}
\item Lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs(LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
\begin{itemize}
\item inhibitory effects of metabolites on pyruvate metabolism.
\end{itemize}
\item Moderate hyperuricaemia - frequent finding during acute attacks.
\item Secondary hyperprolinaemia occurs in some babies with MAD deficiency.
\item Accumulating long-chain acylcarnitines may be responsible for
arrhythmias and may interfere with surfactant metabolism.
\item In LCHAD and MTP deficiencies, long chain hydroxy-acylcarnitine
concentrations correlate with the severity of retinopathy and may
cause both this and the peripheral neuropathy
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:orgaa3c517}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fasted state:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fatty Acids inhibit glucose oxidation at pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH)
\item Long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives directly inhibit glucokinase
\end{itemize}
\item Fed state:
\begin{itemize}
\item Insulin inhibits lipolysis
\item Malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT1
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) esterification of FA
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inhibition of Glucose Utilization by Fatty Acids}
\label{sec:org60d46da}

\caption{\label{fig:org1757a7a}
Inhibition of Glucose Utilization by FA}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The extent of inhibition is graded and most severe at the level of
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and less severe at the level of
6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) and glucose uptake.
\item PDH inhibition is caused by acetyl-CoA and NADH accumulation
resulting from fatty acid oxidation, whereas PFK inhibition results
from citrate accumulation in the cytosol. The mechanism of
inhibition of glucose uptake is not clear.
\item These effects reroute glucose toward glycogen synthesis and pyruvate
to anaplerosis and/or gluconeogenesis.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inhibition of Fatty Acid Utilization by Glucose}
\label{sec:org0886103}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./faod_routine_testing/figures/FAO_inhibition.png}
\caption{\label{fig:org543c965}
Inhibition of FA Utilization by Glucose}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item This mechanism is mediated by malonyl-CoA, the concentration of
which depends on ACC activity and which inhibits the entry of
long-chain fatty acyl (LCFAcyl-CoA) moieties into mitochondria.
\item This effect reroutes fatty acids toward esterification.
\item In extrahepatic tissues, the effect of glucose is stimulated by
insulin.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lactic Acidemia in FAODs}
\label{sec:orgc9be7bb}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (VLCAD, LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
\item Long-chain acyl-CoA esters have been found to inhibit a large
variety of enzymes including the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier.
\begin{itemize}
\item The mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the exchange of intra- and
extra-mitochondrial adenine nucleotides.
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{In vivo} the ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the transport of ATP
synthesized in the mitochondrion by the F\(_{\text{1}}\) F\(_{\text{0}}\)-ATPase reaction to the
extra-mitochondrial space in exchange for cytosolic ADP
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) intra-mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and \(\downarrow\) oxidation of
NADH \(\to\) NAD\(^{\text{+}}\)
\item \(\uparrow\) ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD\(^{\text{+}}\) ratios will activate PDK
\item PDK inactivates PDH by phosphorylation.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Moderate hyperuricaemia and elevated CK}
\label{sec:orgb61881d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Seen in acute attacks 
\begin{itemize}
\item The association suggests that the mechanism is a breakdown of
cells, particularly muscle.
\item ATP depletion \(\to\) \(\downarrow\) Na/K-ATPase
\end{itemize}
\item Release of CK
\item The uric acid excess is the product of nucleic acid and nucleotide catabolism.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AFLP/HELLP}
\label{sec:org46dbad2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
carrying an affected fetus
\item A woman whose affected fetus has the Glu474Gln mutation on one or
both alleles of the \(\alpha\)-subunit of the trifunctional protein is
likely to have acute fatty liver of pregnancy or the HELLP syndrome 
\begin{itemize}
\item Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl metabolites produced by the fetus or
placenta accumulate in the mother and are highly toxic to the liver
\item Exaggerated by the decreased metabolic utilization of fatty acids
during pregnancy.
\end{itemize}
