\begin{enumerate}
\item Fatty Acids
\label{sec:orgf0393e3}
\begin{itemize}
\item usually straight aliphatic chains with a methyl group at one end
(\(\omega\)-carbon) and a carboxyl group and the other end.
\end{itemize}

\item Fatty Acid Nomenclature
\label{sec:orgba5d4dc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-systematic historical names most commonly used.
\begin{description}
\item[{Palmitic acid}] discovered in palm oil
\item[{Stearic acid}] from the Greek word "stear", which means tallow.
\item[{Oleic acid}] oleic means related to, or derived from, olive oil
\end{description}
\item The position of a double bond is designated by the number of the carbon in the double bond that is closest to the carboxyl group
\end{itemize}

multiple FAD-linked dehydrogenases.
\item Includes enzymes of amino acid, choline metabolism and acyl-CoA
dehydrogenases of \(\beta\)-oxidation
\item Defects in ETF or ETFQO lead to multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
(MAD) deficiency (glutaric aciduria type II).
\item MAD deficiency, less often, a result of defects of riboflavin
transport or metabolism
\item ETF and ETFQO deficiencies \(\to\) wide range of clinical severity.
\item Severely affected patients present in the first few days of life
\begin{itemize}

\item low set ears, high forehead and midfacial hypoplasia.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item The malformations resemble those seen in CPT II deficiency but the pathogenesis is unknown.
\item Most patients with neonatal presentation die within a week of birth
\item Others develop cardiomyopathy and die within a few months.
\item Less severe cases can present at any age from infancy to adulthood
\begin{itemize}

hypoventilation or an inability to lift the chin off the chest.

\caption{\label{fig:org854e435}
Inhibition of Glucose Utilization}
\end{figure}

Mechanism of inhibition of glucose utilization by fatty acid
oxidation. The extent of inhibition is graded and most severe at the
level of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and less severe at the level of
6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) and glucose uptake. PDH inhibition is
caused by acetyl-CoA and NADH accumulation resulting from fatty acid
oxidation, whereas PFK inhibition results from citrate accumulation
in the cytosol. The mechanism of inhibition of glucose uptake is not
clear. These effects reroute glucose toward glycogen synthesis and
pyruvate to anaplerosis and/or gluconeogenesis. See text for further
details. CYTO, cytosol; MITO, mitochondria; GLUT4, glucose transporter
4; HK, hexokinase; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose
6-phosphate; CPT I, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; ␤-ox,
␤-oxidation.

Inhibition of Fatty Acid Utilization}
\end{figure}

Mechanism of inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by glucose. This
mechanism is mediated by malonyl-CoA, the concentration of which
depends on ACC activity and which inhibits the entry of long-chain
fatty acyl (LCFAcyl-CoA) moieties into mitochondria. This effect
reroutes fatty acids toward esterification. In extrahepatic tissues,
the effect of glucose is stimulated by insulin. See text for further
details. ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; FAS, fatty acid synthase.

\item Lactic Acidemia in FAODs
\label{sec:org5417511}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (VLCAD, LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
\item Long-chain acyl-CoA esters have been found to inhibit a large
variety of enzymes including the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier.
\begin{itemize}
\item The mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the exchange of intra- and
extra-mitochondrial adenine nucleotides.
\end{itemize}
\item \emph{In vivo} the ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the transport of ATP
synthesized in the mitochondrion by the F\(_{\text{1}}\) F\(_{\text{0}}\)-ATPase reaction to the
extra-mitochondrial space in exchange for cytosolic ADP
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\uparrow\) intra-mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and \(\downarrow\) oxidation of
NADH \(\to\) NAD\(^{\text{+}}\)
\item \(\uparrow\) ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD\(^{\text{+}}\) ratios will activate PDK
\item PDK inactivates PDH by phosphorylation.

both alleles of the \(\alpha\)-subunit of the trifunctional protein is
likely to have acute fatty liver of pregnancy or the HELLP syndrome 
\begin{itemize}

placenta accumulate in the mother and are highly toxic to the liver
\item Exaggerated by the decreased metabolic utilization of fatty acids
during pregnancy.
