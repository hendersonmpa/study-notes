* Routine Biochemistry
** Routine Biochemistry 
- Glucose
- Ketones
- Lactate
- Ammonia
- Uric Acid
- Creatine Kinase (CK)
- Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) & Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platlets (HELLP)
  - Mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
    carrying an affected fetus
** Fasting Hypoglycaemia  in FAODs
- Fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
  - primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
 - The hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic.
  - Ketone bodies can be synthesised (medium-or short-chain FAODs or
    if there is high residual enzyme activity)
  - plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or
    the plasma free fatty acid concentrations.

** Randle Cycle [fn:randle]
- Fasted state:
  - Fatty Acids inhibit glucose oxidation at pyruvate dehydrogenase
    (PDH)
  - Long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives directly inhibit glucokinase
- Fed state:
  - Insulin inhibits lipolysis
  - Malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT1
    - \uparrow esterification of FA

Mechanism of inhibition of glucose utilization by fatty acid
oxidation. The extent of inhibition is graded and most severe at the
level of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and less severe at the level of
6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) and glucose uptake. PDH inhibition is
caused by acetyl-CoA and NADH accumulation resulting from fatty acid
oxidation, whereas PFK inhibition results from citrate accumulation
in the cytosol. The mechanism of inhibition of glucose uptake is not
clear. These effects reroute glucose toward glycogen synthesis and
pyruvate to anaplerosis and/or gluconeogenesis. See text for further
details. CYTO, cytosol; MITO, mitochondria; GLUT4, glucose transporter
4; HK, hexokinase; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose
6-phosphate; CPT I, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; ␤-ox,
␤-oxidation.

Mechanism of inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by glucose. This
mechanism is mediated by malonyl-CoA, the concentration of which
depends on ACC activity and which inhibits the entry of long-chain
fatty acyl (LCFAcyl-CoA) moieties into mitochondria. This effect
reroutes fatty acids toward esterification. In extrahepatic tissues,
the effect of glucose is stimulated by insulin. See text for further
details. ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; FAS, fatty acid synthase.

** Lactic Acidemia in FAODs
- Lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (VLCAD, LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
- Long-chain acyl-CoA esters have been found to inhibit a large
  variety of enzymes including the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier.
 - The mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the exchange of intra- and
   extra-mitochondrial adenine nucleotides.
- /In vivo/ the ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the transport of ATP
  synthesized in the mitochondrion by the F_1 F_0-ATPase reaction to the
  extra-mitochondrial space in exchange for cytosolic ADP
  - \uparrow intra-mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and \downarrow oxidation of
    NADH \to NAD^{+}
  - \uparrow ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD^{+} ratios will activate PDK
  - PDK inactivates PDH by phosphorylation.

  mitochondrial oxidation and reduction of NAD

** Hyperammonaemia in FAODs
- Hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects,
  - with normal or low glutamine concentrations;
  - decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate

Influence of metabolic disorders on function of urea cycle leading to secondary hyperammonemia

** Moderate hyperuricaemia , elevated CK
- Seen in acute attacks 
  - The association suggests that the mechanism is a breakdown of
    cells, particularly muscle.
  - ATP depletion \to \downarrow Na/K-ATPase 
- Release of CK
- The uric acid excess is the product of nucleic acid and nucleotide catabolism. 

** AFLP/HELLP
- Mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
  carrying an affected fetus
- A woman whose affected fetus has the Glu474Gln mutation on one or
  both alleles of the \alpha{}-subunit of the trifunctional protein is
  likely to have acute fatty liver of pregnancy or the HELLP syndrome 
  - Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl metabolites produced by the fetus or
    placenta accumulate in the mother and are highly toxic to the liver
  - Exaggerated by the decreased metabolic utilization of fatty acids
    during pregnancy.
