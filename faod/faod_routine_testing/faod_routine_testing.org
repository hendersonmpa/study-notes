* Routine Biochemistry
- glucose
- ketones
- lactate
- ammonia
- uric acid
- creatine kinase (CK)
- Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) & Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platlets (HELLP)
  - mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
    carrying an affected fetus
** Fasting Hypoglycaemia  in FAODs
- Fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
  - primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
 - The hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic
  - Ketone bodies can be synthesised (medium-or short-chain FAODs or
    if there is high residual enzyme activity)
  - plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or
    the plasma free fatty acid concentrations

** Randle Cycle 
- fasted state:
  - fatty acids inhibit glucose oxidation at pyruvate dehydrogenase
    (PDH)
  - long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives directly inhibit glucokinase
- fed state:
  - insulin inhibits lipolysis
  - malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT1
    - \uparrow esterification of FA

- extent of inhibition is graded and most severe at the level of
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and less severe at the level of
  6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) and glucose uptake
- PDH inhibition is caused by acetyl-CoA and NADH accumulation
  resulting from fatty acid oxidation, whereas PFK inhibition results
  from citrate accumulation in the cytosol. The mechanism of
  inhibition of glucose uptake is not clear
  - reroute glucose toward glycogen synthesis and pyruvate
    to anaplerosis and/or gluconeogenesis

- mechanism is mediated by malonyl-CoA, the concentration of which
  depends on ACC activity and which inhibits the entry of long-chain
  fatty acyl-CoA into mitochondria
- reroutes fatty acids toward esterification
- extrahepatic tissues, the effect of glucose is stimulated by
  insulin

** Lactic Acidemia in FAODs
- lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs (VLCAD, LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
- long-chain acyl-CoA esters have been found to inhibit a large
  variety of enzymes including the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier
 - mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the exchange of intra- and
   extra-mitochondrial adenine nucleotides
- /in vivo/ the ATP/ADP carrier catalyses the transport of ATP
  synthesized in the mitochondrion by the F_1 F_0-ATPase reaction to the
  extra-mitochondrial space in exchange for cytosolic ADP
  - \uparrow intra-mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and \downarrow oxidation of
    NADH \to NAD^{+}
  - \uparrow ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD^{+} ratios will activate PDK
  - PDK inactivates PDH by phosphorylation

** Hyperammonaemia in FAODs
- hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects,
  - with normal or low glutamine concentrations;
  - decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate 
- influence of metabolic disorders on function of urea cycle leading
  to secondary hyperammonemia

** Moderate hyperuricaemia and elevated CK
- seen in acute attacks 
  - association suggests that the mechanism is a breakdown of
    cells, particularly muscle
  - ATP depletion \to \downarrow Na/K-ATPase 
- release of CK
- uric acid excess is the product of nucleic acid and nucleotide catabolism. 

** AFLP/HELLP
- mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency when
  carrying an affected fetus
- woman whose affected fetus has the Glu474Gln mutation on one or
  both alleles of the \alpha-subunit of the trifunctional protein is
  likely to have acute fatty liver of pregnancy or the HELLP syndrome 
  - long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl metabolites produced by the fetus or
    placenta accumulate in the mother and are highly toxic to the liver
  - exaggerated by the decreased metabolic utilization of fatty acids
    during pregnancy
