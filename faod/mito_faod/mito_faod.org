* Carnitine Cycle Defects
** Carnitine Transporter Deficiency
AKA:primary carnitine deficiency, carnitine uptake deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, muscle weakness, liver disease
- precipitated by infection, fasting, pregnancy or antibiotics containing pivalate
- pivalate is excreted bound to carnitine, \downarrow carnitine concentration
  - isobaric with C5-carnitine
- some present in infancy with hypoglycaemia, liver dysfunction and hyperammonaemia
- other children develop heart failure due to cardiomyopathy,
  thickened ventricular walls and reduced contractility
- often accompanied by skeletal muscle weakness
- adults may suffer fatigue or arrhythmias
- screening has shown that many subjects with low plasma carnitine remain asymptomatic
*** Metabolic Derangement
- organic cation/carnitine transporter(OCTN2) responsible for
  carnitine uptake
  - analysis of carnitine transport in different tissues suggests the
    presence of heterogeneous transporters
  - liver and brain have a low-affinity (K_M=2-10 uM), high-capacity transporter
  - fibroblast, muscle, and heart cells have a high-affinity (K_M=5-10 uM), low-capacity system
- defects \to primary carnitine deficiency with \uparrow renal loss of carnitine
  - \downarrow plasma concentrations
  - \downarrow intracellular concentrations \to impair fatty acid
    oxidation
*** Diagnostic Testing
- \Downarrow plasma total carnitine, \lt 5% of normal
- \uparrow urine free carnitine
*** Treatment 
- carnitine supplementation
** Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- usually present by the age of 2 years with hypoketotic hypoglycaemia,
  - induced by fasting or illness
- accompanied by hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction and occasionally cholestasis
  - may also be transient lipaemia and renal tubular acidosis
*** Metabolic Derangement
- *CPT Ia* liver and kidney
- *CPT Ib*  muscle and heart
- *CPT Ic*  brain
- only CPT Ia deficiency has been identified
- CPT I deficiency is extremely common in the Inuit population of Canada and Greenland
  - c.1436C>T, P479L 
- a few of these patients present with hypoglycaemia as neonates or young children
  - most remain asymptomatic

*** Diagnostic Testing
- \uparrow free carnitine
- \downarrow C16, C18, C18:1 acylcarnitines

** Carnitine Acylcarnitine Translocase Deficiency
*** Clinical Presentation
- rare disorder usually presents in the neonatal period, with
  death by 3 months of age
  - severe hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia, cardiomyopathy,
    atrioventricular block and ventricular arrhythmias
- few more mildly affected patients present later with hypoglycaemic
  encephalopathy
  - precipitated by fasting or infections
*** Metabolic Derangement

** Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II Deficiency 
*** Neonatal
- severe neonatal onset CPT II deficiency is usually lethal
- patients become comatose within a few days of birth
  - hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia
  - may have cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias and congenital malformations,
    principally renal cysts and neuronal migration defects
- also an intermediate form of CPT II deficiency that causes
  episodes of hypoglycaemia and liver dysfunction, sometimes
  accompanied by cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias

*** Childhood
- episodes may be brought on by infections or exercise
- moderate or severe episodes there is myoglobinuria, \uparrow CK
  - may lead to acute renal failure
  - CK often normalises between episodes but may remain moderately
    elevated

*** Adolescence,  young adult
- most common form is a partial deficiency that presents with
  episodes of rhabdomyolysis
  - usually precipitated by prolonged exercise
  - particularly in the cold or after fasting 

* \beta-Oxidation Defects
** Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
*** Early infancy 
- severely affected patients present in early infancy with
  cardiomyopathy, in addition to the problems seen in milder patients

*** Childhood
- patients present in childhood with hypoglycaemia but suffer exercise
  or illness induced rhabdomyolysis or chronic weakness at a later age

*** Adolescence, Adult
- mildly affected patients present as adolescents or adults with
  exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis

*** Screening
- second most common FAOD in Europe and the USA 
- prevalence between 1:50,000 and 1:100,000
- much higher than detected clinically
- likely that many patients diagnosed by screening would remain
  asymptomatic without intervention

** Mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein
- MTP a hetero-octamer composed of four \alpha-subunits and four \beta-subunits;
- \alpha-subunit has long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (LCEH) and LCHAD activities
- \beta-subunit has long-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (LCKAT) activity
- patients may have isolated LCHAD deficiency or a generalised deficiency of all three enzyme activities

- mothers who are heterozygous for LCHAD or MTP deficiency have a high
  risk of illness during pregnancies when carrying an affected fetus
- main problems are HELLP syndrome (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver
  enzymes and Low Platelets) and acute fatty liver of pregnancy
  (AFLP)

** Long-Chain 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase
- isolated LCHAD deficiency usually presents acutely before 6 months of age
  - hypoglycaemia, liver dysfunction, lactic acidosis
  - Many have cardiomyopathy, some have hypoparathyroidism or ARDS
- other patients present with chronic symptoms
  - failure to thrive, hypotonia, occasionally cholestasis or cirrhosis
- subsequently, episodes of rhabdomyolysis are common
- many patients develop retinopathy, may start as early as 2 years of age
- granular pigmentation followed by chorioretinal atrophy w deteriorating central vision
- some patients develop cataracts

** Mitochondrial Trifunctional Protein Deficiency
- presentation of generalised MTP deficiency is heterogeneous 
- patients with severe deficiency present as neonates
  - cardiomyopathy, respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia and liver dysfunction
  - most die within a few months, regardless of treatment
- other patients resemble those with isolated LCHAD deficiency
- milder neuromyopathic phenotype:
  - exercise induced rhabdomyolysis and progressive peripheral
    neuropathy
  - can present at any age from infancy to adulthood

** Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- no human disease-causing mutations have been identified
- role  in  human  metabolism  is unclear
- /in vitro/, the substrate specificity of LCAD overlaps with that of
  VLCAD and ACAD9
- enzymes have strong activity toward long-chain acyl-CoAs (C14-20)
- surfactant deficiency and altered lung mechanics in LCAD deficient
  mice
  - postulated that LCAD deficiency in humans may manifest primarily
    as a lung disease
** Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- most common FAOD with an incidence of approximately 1:10,000-20,000
  in Europe,USA and Australia
- before NBS, presented 4 months to 4 years
  - acute hypoglycaemic encephalopathy and liver dysfunction, not always
  - some deteriorated rapidly and died
- precipitated by prolonged fasting or infection with vomiting
- some babies still present within 72 hours of birth before
  newborn screening results are available
  - hypoglycaemia and/or arrhythmias
  - breast-fed babies are at higher risk, due to the small supply of
    breast milk at this stage
- MCAD deficiency only presents clinically if exposed to an
  appropriate environmental stress
- prior to NBS ~ 30-50% remained asymptomatic
- NBS and preventative measures, hypoglycaemia is rare
  - Patients do not develop cardiomyopathy or myopathy and few present
    initially as adults
- healty MCAD deficient children > 1 year can fast for 12-14 hours without problems
- >14 hours \to non-ketotic (inappropriately low) hypoglycaemia
- shorter fasts may cause problems in infancy
- encephalopathy may occur without hypoglycaemia
  - accumulation of FFA acids and carnitine/CoA esters

** Short-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- non-disease?
  - previous association with symptoms due to ascertainment bias?

** 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency
- HADH, previously called SCHAD deficiency, causes hyperinsulinaemic
  hypoglycaemia
- role in modulation of ATP production inhibition of GDH

** Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9
- complex I assembly factor with a moonlighting function in fatty
  acid oxidation deficiencies
- ACAD9 is most homologous to VLCAD
- recombinant ACAD9 displays activity towards long-chain acyl-CoAs,
  very similar to VLCAD
- responsible for production of C14:1-carnitine and C12-carnitine in
  VLCAD deficiency
  - VLCAD^{-/-} cell lines accumulate C14:1
  - VLCAD^{-/-}/ACAD9^{-/-} cell lines accumulate C18:1
- patients with ACAD9 defects present in infancy or childhood with
  myopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lactic acidaemia
  - some also have neurological problems
- myopathic patients often respond to treatment with riboflavin
  - FAD is the enzyme-bound prosthetic group of all acyl-CoA
    dehydrogenases

** COMMENT 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase deficiency
- Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids

#+CAPTION[]:2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase deficiency
#+NAME: fig:dienol
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 0.9\textwidth
[[./mito_faod/figures/dienol.pdf]]

- initially described in 1990 based on a single case who presented with persistent hypotonia
  - elevated lysine, low carnitine
  - abnormal acylcarnitine profile in urine and plasma
- The abnormal acylcarnitine species was 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcarnitine
  - intermediate of linoleic acid metabolism
- The index case died of respiratory failure at four months of age
- Postmortem enzyme analysis on liver and muscle samples revealed
  decreased 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity when compared to normal
  controls
- a deficiency of this enzyme has been shown to occur
  in a patient due to a mutation in the NADK2 gene, a mitochondrial
  NAD kinase
- disruption of NADP synthesis \to secondary deficiencies of
  2,4-dienoyl-coA reductase and \alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde
  synthase

* Electron Transfer Defects 
** Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency 
- AKA glutaric aciduria type II
- Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF ubiquinone
  oxidoreductase (ETFQO) carry electrons to the respiratory chain from
  multiple FAD-linked dehydrogenases
- includes enzymes of amino acid, choline metabolism and acyl-CoA
  dehydrogenases of \beta-oxidation
- defects in ETF or ETFQO \to 
- GAII less often, a result of defects of riboflavin transport or
  metabolism
- ETF and ETFQO deficiencies \to wide range of clinical severity
- severely affected patients present in the first few days of life
 - hypoglycaemia, hyperammonaemia and acidosis
 - hypotonia and hepatomegaly
- there is usually an odour of sweaty feet similar to that in isovaleric acidaemia
- some patients have congenital anomalies
 - large cystic kidneys, hypospadias and neuronal migration defects and facial dysmorphism
   - low set ears, high forehead and midfacial hypoplasia
- the malformations resemble those seen in CPT II deficiency but the pathogenesis is unknown
- most patients with neonatal presentation die within a week of birth
- others develop cardiomyopathy and die within a few months
- less severe cases can present at any age from infancy to adulthood
 - with hypoglycaemia, liver dysfunction and weakness
 - usually precipitated by an infection
- cardiomyopathy is common in infants
- rarer problems include stridor and leukodystrophy
- mildly affected children may have recurrent bouts of vomiting
- muscle weakness is the commonest presentation in adolescents and adults
 - predominantly affects proximal muscles and may lead to scoliosis,
   hypoventilation or an inability to lift the chin off the chest
- weakness can worsen rapidly during infection or pregnancy, myoglobinuria is rare
 - many milder defects respond to riboflavin

* COMMENT Additional Defects
** FA transport
 - The mechanisms of fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane are still not completely clear
 - Impaired uptake has been reported in 2 boys who presented with liver failure
 - The molecular basis was not identified and the diagnoses remains uncertain

** Potential Defects
*** Medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (MCKAT) deficiency
- reported in one patient, who died at 13 days of age
- hypoglycaemia, hyperammonaemia, acidosis and myoglobinuria

*** Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) 
- involved in surfactant metabolism
- LCAD deficiency has been reported in two cases of sudden infant death


* Metabolic Derangement
- fasting hypoglycaemia is the classic metabolic disturbance in FAODs
  - primarily due to increased peripheral glucose consumption
  - hepatic glucose output is also reduced under some conditions
- the hypoglycaemia is hypoketotic
  - ketone bodies can be synthesised
    - medium-or short-chain FAODs or if there is high residual enzyme activity
    - plasma concentrations are lower than expected for hypoglycaemia or the plasma free fatty acid concentrations
- hyperammonaemia occurs in some severe defects
  - with normal or low glutamine concentrations
  - decreased acetyl-CoA production reducing the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate
- lactic acidaemia is seen in long-chain FAODs(LCHAD and MTP deficiencies)
  - inhibitory effects of metabolites on pyruvate metabolism
- moderate hyperuricaemia - frequent finding during acute attacks
- secondary hyperprolinaemia occurs in some babies with MAD deficiency
- accumulating long-chain acylcarnitines may be responsible for
  arrhythmias and may interfere with surfactant metabolism
- in LCHAD and MTP deficiencies, long chain hydroxy-acylcarnitine
  concentrations correlate with the severity of retinopathy and may
  cause both this and the peripheral neuropathy
