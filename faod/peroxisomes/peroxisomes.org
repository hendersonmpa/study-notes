* Introduction
** Peroxisomal FA oxidation
- \beta-oxidation of:
  - very-long-chain fatty acids
    - C22:6-CoA, C22:5-CoA, C26:1-CoA, C26:0-CoA
    - do not degrade fatty acids to completion
  - bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid
  - a range of eicosanoids
- \alpha-oxidation of phytanoyl-CoA \to pristanoly-CoA
  - \beta-oxidation of pristanoly-CoA

- Two acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOX1 & 2)
- Two bifunctional proteins (LBP & DBP)
- Two thiolases (ACAA1 & SCPx). 
- Single enzyme or transport protein defect result in abnormalities in some fatty acids.

** Peroxisomal Disorders
- Peroxisomal \beta-oxidation disorders can be subdivided into two groups:
  1) single peroxisomal enzyme or transport protein deficiencies
     - X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD)
  2) generalized peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiencies.
     - Zellweger syndrome 
- Peroxisomal \alpha-oxidation disorders
  - Adult Refsum
- Sjogren Larsson Syndrome

- Rare Peroxisomal Disorders 
  - Etherphospholipid Biosynthesis
    - Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata (RCDP) 1-4
  - FA Elongation disorders
    - EVOL4, EVOL5,
    - Trans-2,3-Enoyl-CoA Reductase (TER), 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydratase 1 (HACD1)
  - Eicosanoid Metabolism
    - Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy Type 1
    - LTC4-Synthase Deficiency

* X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy
** Clinical Presentation
- 1/20,000 males and females
*** ALD
- childhood cerebral form is the most severe
  - neurological symptoms between 4-12 years
  - vegetative state and death
- Males may present with ADD or behavioural changes
  - due to visuospatial deficits \pm central hearing loss
- followed by severe visual and hearing impairment, quadriplegia and
  cerebellar ataxia.
*** AMN
- Adrenomyeloneuropathy affects 65% of adult X-ALD male patients (20-50 years)
  - up to 88% of heterozygous women (\gt40 years)
- Presentation is progressive spastic paraparesis and sensory ataxia.

** Metabolic Derangement
- Deficiency in ALDP a peroxisomal ABC transporter
- \to \uparrow VLCFA-CoA in cytosol
  - incorporation into a variety of lipids including:
  - cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and sphingolipids
- VLCFAs accumulate in virtually all tissues, including erythrocytes,
  white blood cells and plasma.

** Genetics
- X-ALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1
- X-linked

** Diagnostic Tests

- Quantitative VLCFAs including:C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0 in plasma
  - after alkaline and acid hydrolysis
  - releases the VLCFAs from all lipid species
  - \uparrow concentration of C26:0
  - \uparrow C26:0/C22:0 and C24:0/C22:0 ratios

- In females, normal plasma VLCFA does not exclude XALD
  - mutation analysis is the most reliable method for diagnosis in females

- False-positive results have been reported in:
  - patients on a ketogenic diet
  - recent ingestion of peanut butter

** Treatment
- A boy born with X-ALD has a 35% risk of developing cerebral ALD
  between the age of 4-12 years
- 100% risk of developing AMN between the age of 25-50 years.
- Cerebral X-ALD can be treated in boys and adult males
  - only at a very early stage of the disease,
  - when patients start to develop cerebral demyelination on brain MRI
    but have no or minimal neurologic symptoms.
- HCT can arrest the cerebral demyelination when the procedure is
  performed at a very early stage

* Zellweger Spectrum Disorders
** Clinical Presentation
- Prototypical ZSD:
  1) Typical cranial facial dysmorphia including:
     - high forehead
     - large interior fontanelle
     - hypoplastic supraorbital ridges
     - epicanthal folds
     - flat nasal bridge
     - deformed ear lobes
  2) Profound neurological abnormalities

** Metabolic Derangement
- Absence or marked deficiency of peroxisomes
  - assessed by catalase-staining in fibroblasts
  - using immunofluorescence microscopy analysis
- All peroxisomal functions are impaired.
- In classical ZSD abnormalities include:
  - \uparrow VLCFAs
  - \uparrow pristanic acid,
  - \uparrow di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid,
  - \uparrow pipecolic acid
  - \downarrow plasmalogens in erythrocytes

** Genetics
- The genetic basis of the ZSD is heterogeneous
- Biallelic mutations identified in:
  - PEX1, PEX2, PEX3, PEX5, PEX6, PEX10, PEX12, PEX13, PEX14, PEX16, PEX19, and PEX26
- All disorders are autosomal recessive

** Diagnostic Tests
- VLCFA analysis is a good initial biochemical test
- erythrocyte plasmalogens
- pipecolic acid upon amino acid analysis
- DNA-panel containing all PEX genes or all genes coding for
  peroxisomal protein

** Treatment
- No treatment available
- supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is not beneficial
- Investigating cholic acid supplementation to reduce formation of the
  toxic bile acid intermediates DHCA and THCA

* Adult Refsum Disease
** Clinical Presentation
- present in late childhood with:
  - progressive loss of night vision
  - decline in visual capacity
  - anosmia
- After \ge 10 years patients may develop:
  - deafness, ataxia, polyneuropathy, ichthyosis, fatigue, and cardiac
    conduction disturbances
- full constellation of features defined by Refsum includes:
  - retinitis pigmentosa, cerebellar ataxia and chronic polyneuropathy
- rarely seen in single patients with ARD

** Metabolic derangement
- Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is deficient in ARD
- required for \alpha-oxidation of phytanic acid
- \to accumulation of phytanic acid

** Genetics
- ARD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in PHYH.
- A large number of often private mutations has been identified

** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow plasma phytanic acid 
- \uparrow phytanic acid in ZS
  - initially called infantile Refsum

** Treatment
- Dietary restriction of phytanic acid 
  - critical to minimize ongoing tissue accumulation.
- The largest sources of phytanic acid and its metabolic precursor phytol are:
  - dairy products, meats and certain fish
- vegetables do not need to be restricted
  - phytanic acid is not released from chlorophyll
- avoid rapid weight loss
  - may mobilize phytanic acid from adipose tissue
- Can halt progression of symptoms and some functional recovery if the
  disease is recognized early and dietary restriction and regular
  lipid apheresis are maintained life-long.

* Sj\ouml{}gren Larsson Syndrome
** Clinical Presentation
- Classical tetrad of abnormalities in SLS includes:
  1) ichthyosis
  2) spasticity
  3) ophthalmological abnormalities
  4) intellectual disability
- full-blown phenotype of SLS is not observed in all patients
- manifests later on in childhood \gt 3 years of age.

** Metabolic Derangement
- Enzyme deficient in SLS is fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH)
- degradation of long-chain fatty alcohols and leukotriene B4

** Genetics
- SLS is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in
  ALD-H3A2
- a range of different mutations including missense, nonsense,
  splice-site and deletions has been reported.
 
** Diagnostic Tests
- \uparrow long-chain fatty alcohols in plasma
- \uparrow LTB4 metabolites in urine.
  - No easy methods have been described to measure these metabolites
- enzymatic analysis is the method of choice
  - can be done in polymorphonuclear lymphocytes using pyrenedecanal as substrate
  - identification of FALDH-deficiency in candidate patients.

** Treatment
- Treatment of SLS patients is focused on the spasticity and prevention of contracture development.
- One of the key problems in SLS patients is the striking pruritus
  - may originate from LTB4 accumulation.
- Zileuton, inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking its biosynthesis
  - effective in managing chronic (severe) asthma.
- improvement of pruritus
  - \downarrow urinary LTB4
  - \downarrow lipid peak on MRS.
- A double-blind placebo controlled trial is currently underway
