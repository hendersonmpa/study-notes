* Lysosomal Enzymes
- activity assays report rates (umol/L/h)

** 4MU Iduronidase Assay
- 4-MU-\alpha-L-iduronide is a fluorogenic substrate
  of \alpha-iduronidase is incubated with whole blood or leukocytes for ~ 20 hours
  - 5 hours possible
- 4-MU is quenched when linked to \alpha-L-iduronide
  - ex=360 and em=445

*** Known Issues
**** Pseudodeficiency
 - low /in vitro/ \alpha-iduronidase activity with native and 4-MU
   substrates
 - known PD alleles:
   - p.A300T, p.A79T, p.H82Q, p.D223N, p.V322E

**** Sample Quality 
 - poor sample quality \to low enzyme activity
   - measurement of control enzymes useful

** Multiplex DBS Assay
 - a single 3-mm DBS punch, which is incubated in a single-assay
   cocktail with all substrates and internal standards for ~ 20 hours
 - after incubation and liquid-liquid extraction, samples are analyzed by flow injection MS/MS
 - all deuterated internal standards correspond to enzymatically generated products

** Hexosamindase
- total hexosaminidases (A+B) using a synthetic fluorogenic substrate
  allows the diagnosis of Sandhoff disease
- differential assay of HexA using heat or acid
  inactivation does not identify patients with the B1 variant
- HexA is heat-labile while Hex B is not
- an artificial substrate is most commonly used
- total hexosaminidase activity is quantified
  - following this, heat inactivation of HexA occurs with a second
    measurement of the total enzyme level
  - from this, the percent HexA is calculated
    - HexA = [Prior to Heat] - [After Heat]
    - HexA = Total - HexB
- Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by normal total hexosaminidase
  with a very low percent HexA (Table [[tab:gm2]])
- carriers of Tay-Sachs disease are asymptomatic, but have
  intermediate percent HexA in serum and leukocytes
- follow-up molecular testing is recommended for all individuals with
  enzyme results in the carrier or possible carrier ranges to
  differentiate carriers of a pseudodeficiency allele from those with
  a disease-causing mutation

*** HexA Assay
- the direct assay of hexosaminidase A using the sulfated synthetic
  substrate (4-MU-6-sulfo-\beta-glucosaminide) specific for the
  \alpha-subunit is the method of choice
- /in vitro/ hexoaminidase activity: leukocytes, fibroblasts
  - 4-MU-6-sulfo-\beta-glucosaminide
  - specific for the \alpha subunit
- falsely normal results in Tay-Sachs female carriers

*** B1 Variant
- very small group of patients affected with Tay-Sachs disease have
  mutations referred to as the B1 variant of Hex A
- in the presence of an artificial substrate, the B1 variant allows
  for a heterodimer formation of HexA and exhibits
  activity
  - /in vivo/ the B1 variant HexA is inactive on the natural
    substrate
  - with the artificial substrate, these patients appear to be
    unaffected
  - B1 variant of Tay-Sachs disease must be distinguished using a
    natural substrate assay
  - patients with at least one B1 variant typically become symptomatic
    beyond the infantile period
