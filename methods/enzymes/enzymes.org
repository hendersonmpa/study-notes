* Lysosomal Enzymes
** Multiplex DBS Assay
 - the DBS screening assay tests for:
   - Gaucher
   - Krabbe
   - Niemann-Pick-A/B
   - Pompe
   - Fabry
   - MPS-I
 - a single 3-mm DBS punch, which is incubated in a single-assay
   cocktail with all substrates and internal standards
 - after incubation and liquid-liquid extraction, samples are analyzed by flow injection MS/MS
 - all deuterated internal standards correspond to enzymatically generated products


** Hexosamindase
- testing for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases occurs by analysis of hexosaminidase A, a heat-labile enzyme, and total hexosaminidase (hexosaminidase A plus hexosaminidase B)
- an artificial substrate is most commonly used
- total hexosaminidase is quantified
  - following this, heat inactivation of hexosaminidase A occurs with a second measurement of the total enzyme level
  - from this, the percent hexosaminidase A is calculated
- Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by normal total hexosaminidase with a very low percent hexosaminidase A
- carriers of Tay-Sachs disease are asymptomatic, but have intermediate percent hexosaminidase A in serum and leukocytes
- follow-up molecular testing is recommended for all individuals with
  enzyme results in the carrier or possible carrier ranges to
  differentiate carriers of a pseudodeficiency allele from those with
  a disease-causing mutation
- this allows for the facilitation of prenatal diagnosis for at-risk
  pregnancies

| Disorder   | Enzyme | Total Hexosamindase | Hex A      | Percent    |
|------------+--------+---------------------+------------+------------|
| Tay-Sachs  | HexA   | N                   | \Downarrow | \Downarrow |
| TS carrier | Hex    | \dowarrow           | \downarrow | \downarrow |
| Sandhoff   | HexA/B | \Downarrow          | \Downarrow | \uparrow   |


*** B1 Variant
- very small group of patients affected with Tay-Sachs disease have
  mutations referred to as the B1 variant

- in the presence of an artificial substrate, the B1 variant allows
  for a heterodimer formation of hexosaminidase A and exhibits
  activity

  - in vivo the B1 variant hexosaminidase A is inactive on the natural
    substrate

  - with the artificial substrate, these patients appear to be
    unaffected.

  - B1 variant of Tay-Sachs disease must be distinguished using a
    natural substrate assay.

  - patients with at least one B1 variant typically become symptomatic
    beyond the infantile period
