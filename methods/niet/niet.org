* Exercising Muscle
** Lactate
- lactate, ammonia and purine compounds are generated by exercising muscle
- exercising muscle generates lactic acid from the anaerobic breakdown
  of glycogen to pyruvate
  - pyruvate \to lactate
- lactate enters the circulation and is converted back to pyruvate in
  the liver by LDH (Figure [[fig:ldh]])

** ATP
- some ATP regeneration is provided by glycolytic metabolism of fuels,
  but this is relatively slow
- most ATP regeneration relys on creatine kinase catalysed transfer of
  phosphate from phosphocreatine

 \ce{phosphocreatine + ADP ->[CK] creatine + ATP}

- adenylatekinase transphosphorylates ATP to be regenerated with the formation
  of AMP

 \ce{2ADP ->[ADK] ATP + AMP}

- AMP deaminase

 \ce{AMP ->[AMPD] IMP + NH4+}

- IMP degraded to hypoxanthine
- recycled back to AMP in the purine nucleotide cycle

** Ammonia
 - most ammonia produced by exercising muscle removed by formation of glutamine (Figure [[fig:gln]])
   - ultimately excreted as urea
 - some ammonia is released by exercising skeletal muscle directly into the circulation
   - removed with a half-life of 20\pm30 min
 - in resting skeletal muscle ammonia is consumed rather than produced
 - ~50% of arterial ammonia can be taken up and metabolized by skeletal muscle
