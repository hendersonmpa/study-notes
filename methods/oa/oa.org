* Urine Organic Acids by GC-MS
** Oximation
- not always done, sometime a reflex when 2-keto acids present
  - lactic acidemia, ketonuria
- oximated with 10% hydroxylamine-HCL
  - avoids multiple TMS species due to keto-enol tautomerism

** GC-MS
- detected by electron impact mass spectrometry performed in the scan mode
- mass range between m/z 50 and 550
- identification is achieved by comparison to published spectra of
  bona fide compounds, or spectra generated by in-house analysis of
  pure standard compounds
- quantification is by comparison to calibration of pure standard
  compounds in ratio to an internal standard
