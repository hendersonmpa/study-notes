* Berry Spot Test
- provides a rapid qualitative evaluation of urine (Figure [[fig:bs]])
- GAGs react with toluidine blue, a cationic dye, to yield a pink-colored compound
- false-negatives and false-positives specimens
- this fast procedure may pick up patients who have been referred to a
  laboratory for other metabolic examinations
- the

* Spectrophotometric 
- total GAGs
- urine sample
- 1,9-dimethylene blue (DMB) forms a complex with sulfated GAGs
  present in urine that can be measured at 520 nm

* Fractionation 
- TLC or electrophoresis used to fractionate urine GAGs (Figures [[fig:tlc]] and [[fig:gel]])
- stained with alcian blue

* COMMENT Non-reducing ends and Internal Disacchararides

- Eliminative depolymerization of a heparan sulfate oligosaccharide
  with heparan lyase results in the release of internal disaccharide
  residues (dashed arrows) that contain an unsaturated uronic acid
  moiety (dotted circles).


- Because of its terminal location, the nonreducing end liberated from
  the left end of the chain as drawn lacks the \delta 4,5-double bond and is
  18 amu larger than a corresponding internal disaccharide.


- Reductive amination with aniline ([12C6]An) facilitates separation
  of the various disaccharides by LC/MS, yielding the m/z values for
  the molecular ions indicated within the parentheses.

 - The defective enzyme for each MPS subclass is displayed along with
   the liberated NRE carbohydrates characteristic of MPS I, II, IIIA,
   IIIB, IIIC, IIID, VI and VII using geometric symbols.
 - The matrices show all NRE carbohydrates that are theoretically
   possible for each MPS subclass.
 - The boxes with a black background and whiteface font depict
   structures that were detected and whose identities were confirmed
   by their cochromatography and identical mass spectra as standards,
   as well as their sensitivity to exoglycosidases or propionic acid
   anhydride.
 - Suspected structures shown in boxes with a gray background are
   implied from the liquid chromatography/mass spectra data,
   - i.e. their size and content of sulfate and acetate groups are
     consistent with the proposed structures.
 - The structures in boxes with a white background are theoretically
   possible, but have not been observed.
 - The m/z values for both the free molecular ions and adduction ions
   formed with the ion pairing reagent dibutylamine (DBA) are listed

** Endogenous NRE GAG: UA-HNAc(1S)
- Endogenous enzymes present in human tissues can also cleave GAG
  chains, and an endogenous disaccharide biomarker was reported to be
  elevated in urine from MPS-I patients.
- This biomarker contains a uronic acid (iduronic acid or glucuronic
  acid) linked to N-acetyl-hexosamine (contains a uronic acid
  (iduronic acid or glucuronic acid) linked to N-acetyl-hexosamine
  (GlcNAc or GalNAc) and contains a single sulfate.
-  Its exact structure is unknown, and we refer to it as UA-HNAc(1S)
  (presumably UA is iduronic acid rather than glucuronic acid, but
  this was not proven).
