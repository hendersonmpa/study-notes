** Exercising Muscle
*** Lactate
 - Lactate, ammonia and purine compounds are generated by exercising muscle.
 - Exercising muscle generates lactic acid from the anaerobic breakdown
   of glycogen to pyruvate
   - \ce{pyruvate \to lactate}
 - Lactate enters the circulation and is converted back to pyruvate in the liver.

*** ATP

- Some ATP regeneration is provided by glycolytic metabolism of fuels,
  but this is relatively slow
- Most ATP regeneration relys on creatine kinase catalysed transfer of
  phosphate from phosphocreatine.

  - \ce{phosphocreatine + ADP ->[CK] creatine + ATP}

- adenylatekinase transphosphorylates ATP to be regenerated with the formation
  of AMP

  - \ce{2ADP ->[ADK] ATP + AMP}

- AMP deaminase
  - \ce{AMP ->[AMPD] IMP + NH4+}

- IMP degraded to hypoxanthine
- recycled back to AMP in the purine nucleotide cycle.

*** Ammonia
 - Most ammonia produced by exercising muscle removed by formation of glutamine
   - ultimately excreted as urea
 - Some ammonia is released by exercising skeletal muscle directly into the circulation
   - removed with a half-life of 20\pm30 min.
 - In resting skeletal muscle ammonia is consumed rather than produced
 - ~50% of arterial ammonia can be taken up and metabolized by skeletal muscle.
