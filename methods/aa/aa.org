#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Introduction
** Amino Acids: A Very Short Introduction
- Amino acids are mono or dicarboxylic acids with one or more amino groups.
  - Zwitterion at ph 7.45

- Proteinogenic amino acids (22)
  - 21 amino acids naturally incorportated into polypeptides in humans
  - 20 genetically encoded
  - selenocysteine

- Non-proteinogenic
  - post-translational modification
    - hydroxylation of proline \to hydroxyproline
  - Not found in proteins
    - gamma-aminobutryic acid
    - ornithine, citrulline

- 76 amino acids of biological interest in humans

** Indications for Measurement of Amino Acids
- Diagnosis of inborn errors of amino acid metabolism and transport
- Diet monitoring in patients with known IEM
- Nutritional assessment of patients with non-metabolic conditions [e.g. short bowel syndrome] 
- Signs and symptoms:
  1. Lethargy, coma, seizures or vomiting in a neonate
  2. Hyperammonaemia
  3. Ketosis
  4. Metabolic acidosis or lactic acidaemia
  5. Alkalosis
  6. Metabolic decompensation
  7. Unexplained developmental delay or developmental regression
  8. Polyuria, polydipsia and dehydration
  9. Unexplained liver dysfunction
  10. Unexplained neurological symptoms
  11. Abnormal amino acid results on newborn screening programme
  12. Previous sibling with similar clinical presentation
  13. Clinical presentation specific to an amino acid disorder
  14. Monitoring treatment and diet.

| Alanine               | Glutamine           | Ornithine             |
| Alloisoleucine        | Glycine             | Phenylalanine         |
| Arginine              | Histidine           | Proline               |
| Argininosuccinic acid | Homocysteine [fn:1] | Serine                |
| Cystine               | Isoleucine          | Sulphocysteine [fn:2] |
| Citrulline            | Leucine             | Taurine               |
| Glutamic acid         | Lysine              | Threonine             |
| Valine                | Methionine          | Tyrosine              |
[fn:1] Plasma total homocysteine is not detected by routine methods, plasma free homocystine analysis has poor clinical sensitivity.
[fn:2] Sulphocysteine may not be detectable in plasma using routine methods

** Plasma
- Patient prep
  - Fasting (overnight preferred, 4 hours minimum). Infants and children should be
    drawn just before next feeding (2-3 hours without TPN if possible).
- Sample
  - LiHeparin venous plasma
  - Prompt separation and deproteinisation is essential for accurate measurement of (free) sulphur containing amino acids.
  - Protein binding: cystine and homocystine
  - release of arginase from RBCs
  - store at -20\degree{}C to limit glutamine decomposition

** Plasma - Pre-analytical
- Serum should not be used because there may be deamination (asparagine to
  aspartic acid and glutamine to glutamic acid), loss of sulphur
  containing amino acids and release of oligopeptides.
- EDTA plasma is recommended in some labs as the specimen of
  choice. The older literature reports ninhydrin positive artefacts in
  EDTA plasma but modern tubes do not seem to have this problem.
- Haemolysis will cause increases in serine, glycine, taurine,
  phosphoethanolamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, ornithine and
  decreased arginine.
- Delayed separation or leucocyte and platelet contamination will
  cause increased serine, glycine, taurine, phosphoethanolamine,
  ornithine, glutamic acid and decreased arginine, homocystine,
  cystine.
- Phenylalanine and tyrosine increase if specimen separation is
  delayed 
- Amino acids are more stable in frozen deproteinised plasma than
  in frozen native plasma.
- Capillary blood may be used with careful cleaning of the skin prior
  to specimen collection provided the blood is flowing freely.
- Free tryptophan may be lost when using sulphosalicylic acid as
  deproteinising agent.
  - trichloroacetic acid is the deproteinising agent of choice for
    this amino acid.
- Sodium metabisulphite, found in some intravenous preparations as a
  preservative, can cause the conversion of cystine to sulphocysteine.

** Urine
- Urine
  - 24 hour or random urine
  - preservative free bottle
  - Specimen quality is checked by testing for nitrite and pH.
    - Specimen deterioration causes:
      - \downarrow serine
      - \uparrow \downarrow alanine
      - increased glycine
      - decarboxylation of glutamic acid \to \gamma{}-aminobutyric acid
      - breakdown of phosphoethanolamine \to ethanolamine and phosphate
      - breakdown of cystathionine \to homocystine
      - hydrolysis of peptides causing \uparrow proline
  - Fecal contamination causes increased proline, glutamic acid, branched chain amino acids but not hydroxyproline.
  - Faecal bacteria can produce \gamma{}-aminobutyric acid from glutamic acid and b-alanine from aspartic acid
  - reported in \micro{}mol/g creatinine
  - Aminoaciduria due to overflow and amino acid transport defects.

** Cerebral Spinal Fluid
  - free of blood contamination
  - which tube is used?
  - investigation of neurological disorders and essential for the
    diagnosis of non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia.
  - CSF/Plasma ratio of amino acids is more informative than an isolated CSF sample.
    - A paired plasma sample should be obtained within two hours.
** Sample prep
- Hydrophillic amino acids require deprotonization with acetonitrile or alcohol
- Deproteination to release cysteine, homocysteine and tryptophan.

* Amino Acid Analyser
- Cation-exchange chromatography using a lithium buffer system
  followed by post-column derivatization with ninhydrin
- Samples are de-proteinized with sulfosalicylic acid prior to
  injection
- Utilizes a lithium-based cation-exchange column
- Eluting amino acids undergo post column reaction with ninhydrin
- Optical detection in the visible spectrum
  - amino acids: 570nm
  - imino acids 440 nm
