* Transferrin IEF
- serum transferrin IEF is the screening method of choice
  - can detect nearly all known CDG-I types as well as most CDG-II types and many CDG-X cases
  - N-glycosylation disorders associated with sialic acid deficiency
  - does not detect CDG-IIb or IIc
- normal serum transferrin is mainly composed of:
  - tetrasialotransferrin and small amounts of mono, di, tri, penta
    and hex-asialotransferrins
- partial deficiency of sialic acid (-ve charge) causes a
  cathodal shift
- two main types of cathodal shift can be recognized:
  - Type 1 :: ER defects that impair lipid-linked oligosaccharide
    assembly and transfer
  - Type 2 :: Golgi defects that affect trimming of the
    protein-bound oligosaccharide or the addition of sugars to it

** Type 1 pattern
 - \uparrow disialo and asialotransferrin
 - \downarrow  tetra, penta and hexasialotransferrins
 - defects in the assembly of the dolichol lipid-linked
   oligosaccharide chain and transfer to the nascent protein
 - CDG-Ia or CDG-Ib should be considered first
 - also seen in secondary glycosylation disorders such as:
   - *chronic alcoholism, hereditary fructose intolerance and galactosaemia*

** Type 2 pattern
  - Type 1 pattern with additional \uparrow tri \pm
    monosialotransferrin bands
  - defects in the trimming and processing of the protein-bound
    glycans either late in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi
    compartments
 - also seen in *liver dysfunction*

** Transferrin IEF limitations
- deficiencies of ER-glucosidase I (CDG-IIb) and Golgi GDP-fucose
  transporter (CDG-IIc) are missed
- prenatal diagnostics by IEF analysis from fetal blood is not
  reliable
- IEF of serum from children \lt 2 weeks may be false-positive
- CDG patients can have normal IEF in the first 1-2 months of life
- heavy alcohol consumption can also result in serum transferrin
  deficiency in carbohydrate moieties may cause Type I patterns
- galactosemia and HFI may cause Type I patterns
- mutations in the protein backbone of transferrin may result in a
  cathodal shift so that trisialotransferrin migrates in a similar
  position to tetrasialotransferrin
  - desialylation of transferrin by neuraminidase treatment or IEF of
    an alternative glycoprotein like \alpha 1-antitrypsin should be
    performed

- Always recommend to exclude secondary causes prior to additional
  diagnostic investigations

* Additional Laboratory Investigations
- protein-linked glycan analysis can be performed to identify the defective step
  - MALDI-TOF analysis of released N-linked oligosaccharides
- CDG gene panel analysis or WES
- capillary zone electrophoresis of total serum is a rapid screening
  test for CDG
  - an abnormal result should be further investigated by serum
    transferrin IEF
- HPLC-UV/Vis
