* Method
- gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis
- after derivatisation with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)
  trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA)
- a robust and reliable method for the quantitative analysis of VLCFA,
  pristanic acid and phytanic acid

*** Procedure
- to measure the total pool of VLCFA, pristanic acid and phytanic
  acid, samples need to be subjected to both acidic and alkaline
  hydrolysis, followed by extraction into hexane
- after the hexane phase is washed once more, the sample is dried
  under nitrogen followed by addition of pyridine and MTBSTFA and
  heating of the samples at 80C
- the sample is dried again under nitrogen and taken up in hexane,
  followed by GC-MS analysis
