** COMMENT Inhibitors 
*** CI 
- the best-known inhibitor of complex I is rotenone commonly used as
  an organic pesticide
  - rotenone binds to the ubiquinone binding site of complex I
- piericidin A is a potent inhibitor and structural homologue to
  ubiquinone
- hydrophobic inhibitors like rotenone or piericidin likely disrupt
  electron transfer between FeS cluster N2 and ubiquinone
- bullatacin is the most potent known inhibitor of NADH dehydrogenase
  (ubiquinone)
- Complex I is also blocked by adenosine diphosphate
  ribose
  - a reversible competitive inhibitor of NADH oxidation

*** CII
 - there are two distinct classes of inhibitors of complex II:
   - those that bind in the succinate pocket and those that bind in the ubiquinone pocket
 - ubiquinone type inhibitors include carboxin and thenoyltrifluoroacetone
 - succinate-analogue inhibitors include the synthetic compound malonate as well as the TCA cycle intermediates, malate and oxaloacetate
   - oxaloacetate is one of the most potent inhibitors of Complex II
*** CIII 
  - there are three distinct groups of Complex III inhibitors:
    - antimycin A binds to the Q_i site and inhibits the transfer of electrons in Complex III from heme b_H to oxidized Q (Q_i site inhibitor)
    - myxothiazol and stigmatellin bind to distinct but overlapping pockets within the Q_o site
      - myxothiazol binds nearer to cytochrome bL (hence termed a "proximal" inhibitor)
      - stigmatellin binds farther from heme bL and nearer the Rieske Iron sulfur protein
      - both inhibit the transfer of electrons from reduced QH_2 to the Rieske Iron sulfur protein

*** CIV
 - cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide all bind to cytochrome c
   oxidase 
 - nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, can also inhibit COX by
   binding to regulatory sites on the enzyme
*** CV
 - Oligomycin A inhibits ATP synthase by blocking its proton channel
   (F_0 subunit), which is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation of
   ADP to ATP (energy production)
 - The inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin A will significantly
   reduce electron flow through the electron transport chain; however,
   electron flow is not stopped completely due to a process known as
   proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling
   - This process is due to facilitated diffusion of protons into the
     mitochondrial matrix through an uncoupling protein such as
     thermogenin, or UCP1

 - Administering oligomycin to an individual can result in very high
   levels of lactate accumulating in the blood and urine

* Citrate Synthase
** Purpose
- citrate synthase (CS) is the initial enzyme of the TCA cycle
- is an exclusive marker of the mitochondrial matrix 
** Procedure
- CS catalyzes the reaction between acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetic acid to
  form citric acid and CoA-SH

\ce{acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate ->[CS] Citrate + CoA-SH + H+ + H2O} 

- CoA-SH reacts with the 5,5â€²-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)(DTNB) in
  the reaction mixture to form 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB)

\ce{CoA-SH + DTNB -> TNB + CoA-S-S-TNB}

- absorbance of the yellow product (TNB) is measured at 412 nm

** Purpose
- determine the rate of cytochrome c reduction in mitochondria as a
  result of electron transfer from NADH to cytochrome c (mitochondrial
  complex I+III) activity
- Complex I transfers electrons to ubiquinone (CoQ) through a
  long series of redox groups
- Complex III catalyzes electron transfer between ubiquinol(CoQH_2)
  and cytochrome c and also translocates protons across the MIM

** Principle
- reduced cytochrome c absorbs light at 550 nm
- increase of the absorption at 550 nm corresponding to the increased
  formation of reduced cytochrome c by electrons derived from NADH,
  which is rotenone sensitive
- azide is added to inhibit CIV so there is no re-oxidation of reduced cytochrome c
- rotenone is added to the reference cuvette to inhibit Complex I
  - assay cuvette :: oxidized cyt c & azide
  - reference cuvette :: oxidized cyt c & azide & rotenone

- spectrophotometer subtracts the activity seen in the reference cell
  from the activity seen in the assay cell, the progress curve you see
  on the computer screen reflects activity of cytochrome c reduction
  by electrons passing ONLY through complex I

** Purpose
- determining the rate of NADH oxidation in mitochondria as a result
  of electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone 
** Principle 
- NADH absorbs light at 340 nm
- the method follows the decrease of the absorption at 340 nm
  corresponding to the decreased concentration of NADH, which has been
  oxidized to NAD during the passage of electrons to ubiquinone
- assay is rotenone sensitive
- rotenone in the reference cuvette will specifically inhibit CI
  therefore any oxidation of NADH from this cell does not include the
  contribution of CI
  - assay cuvette :: ubiquinone &  antimycin A
  - reference cuvette :: ubiquinone &  antimycin A & rotenone

** Purpose
- Complex II activity
** Principle
- secondary reduction of the dye 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP)
  by the CoQH_2 at 600nm

  diaphorases
- caution is recommended in interpreting results from non-muscle
  tissue, rich in diaphorase
  - assay cuvette :: succinate, ubiquinone & DCPIP 
  - reference cuvette :: ubiquinone & DCPIP

** Purpose
- measure rate of CII and III activity in mitochondria 
  - complexes II and III are sometimes called succinate cytochrome c reductase (SCR)
- Complex II performs a key step in the citric acid cycle in which
  succinate is dehydrogenated to ubiquinone in the mitochondrial inner
  membrane
- Complex II is localized to the matrix side of the mitochondrial
  inner membrane and it is the only respiratory chain enzyme of which
  all 4 subunits are coded by the nuclear DNA
- Complex III catalyzes electron transfer between ubiquinol and
  cytochrome c and also translocates protons across the mitochondrial
  inner membrane

** Principle
- reduced cytochrome c absorbs light at 550 nm
- the increase of the absorption at 550 nm corresponds to the
  increased formation of reduced cytochrome c by electrons derived
  from succinate
  - assay cuvette :: sample, oxidized cyt c, azide & succinate 
  - reference cuvette :: oxidized cyt c, azide & succinate

** Purpose
- determine the rate of cytochrome C oxidation in mitochondria as a
  result of cytochrome C oxidase (mitochondrial complex IV, COX)
  activity
- COX is a multisubunit assembly in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  responsible for the terminal event in electron transport in which
  molecular oxygen is reduced
- various phenotypic forms of COX deficiency have been recognized, the
  major varieties involving the degeneration of the brain stem and
  basal ganglia (Leigh syndrome) and lactic acidemia with or without
  cardiomyopathy

** Principle
- reduced cytochrome c absorbs light at 550nm
- methods follows the decrease in absorbance of reduced cytochrome c
  at 550 nm
  - assay cuvette :: sample & reduced cyt c 
  - reference cuvette :: reduced cyt c

* CV assay
** Purpose
- determine the activity of respiratory chain CV in isolated
  muscle and fibroblast mitochondria

** Principle
- ATP hydrolysis via the ATPase activity of CV generates ADP which is
  reconverted to ATP by the action of PK, thus maintaining a constant
  concentration of ATP and a low steady state concentration of ADP
- pyruvate production from PEP and ADP, catalysed by PK, is monitored
  as a rate of oxidation of NADH by coupling to LDH
- ATPase is oligomycyn sensitive
  - assay cuvette :: LDH, PK, PEP & rotenone
  - reference cuvette :: LDH, PK, PEP, rotenone & oligomycin
