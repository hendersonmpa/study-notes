* Methods for Metabolites
1) ALA
2) PBG
3) urinary porphyrins
4) fecal porphyrins
5) blood porphyrins
** Specimen Collection and Stability
- protect from light
- urinary porphyrins and PBG best collected in fresh random urine
  without preservative
- very dilute urine (creatinine <2 mmol/L) is not suitable
** Methods for Porphyrin Precursors
*** Porphobilinogen
- ehrlich's reagent
  - inhibited by urobilinogen \therefore ion-exchange prior to remove
*** 5-Aminolevulinic Acid
- converted to Ehrlich's reacting pyrrole via condensation with
  acetylacetone
*** Analysis of Porphyrins in Urine and Feces
- screening via spectrophotometric scanning of acidified urine or
  fecal extracts for the soret band
*** Semiquantitative Method for Total Porphyrin in Urine and Feces
- done as a screen
*** HPLC Fractionation of Porphyrins in Urine and Feces
- fluorometric detection

** Methods for Blood Porphyrins
*** Determination of Erythrocyte Total Porphyrin
- increased in:
  - EPP
  - CEP
  - homozygous variants
  - iron deficiency
  - hemolytic anemia
  - some other forms of anemia
  - lead poisoning
- total porphyrin concentration within RI excludes EPP
    - distinction between EPP and other causes requires differentiation
      between protoporphyrin and ZN-protoporphyrin
*** Qualitative Determination of ZN-protoporphyrin and Protoporphyrin
- emission peaks for ZPP = 587 nm and free protoporphyrin = 630 nm
- in EPP the concentration of free protoporphyrin >> ZPP
  - may be 60% of total porphyrin
- in lead poisoning, iron deficiency and other anemias ZPP is the main
  component
- limitation of method is that extraction of ZPP is ~50%

** Analysis of Plasma Porphyrins
*** Fluorescence emision Spectroscopy of Plasma Porphyrins
- emission spectra of saline diluted plasma excited at 405 nm
- in VP the plasma contains porphyrin covalently bound to protein with
  Em_max at 624 to 628 nm
- other porphyrias contain porphyrin non-covalently bound to albumin
  and hemopexin
  - fresh plasma protoporphyrin Em_max = 632 nm
  - older sample: binding to globulin released from red cells Em_max =
    626 nm
- 2\degree causes of increase include: impaired excretion, renal
  failure, cholestasis

* Enzyme Measurements
- rarely required for patients with symptoms
- can be used for family studies, DNA is better
** Assay of Etythrocyte Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase Activity
- measures rate of formation of porphyrinogens from PBG by hemolysed erythrocytes
- discriminates between AIP and unaffected relatives
- interferences:
  - HMBS activity declines sharply with erythrocyte age
  - affected by \prop of retics, and young cells in peripheral blood
  - \uparrow in acute illness, ie acute porphyria
  - \sim 1:800 low HMBS activity in France
