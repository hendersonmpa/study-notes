* Methods for Metabolites
1) ALA
2) PBG
3) Urinary Porphyrins
4) Fecal Porphyrins
5) Blood Porphyrins
** Specimen Collection and Stability
- Protect from light
- Urinary porphyrins and PBG best collected in fresh random urine
  without preservative. Very dilute urine (creatinine <2 mmol/L) is
  not suitable
- 24 hour urine offer little advantage
  1) delay diagnosis
  2) increased risk of degradation
** EQA
- EPNET http://www.porphyria-europe.com
  - open to lab throughout the world
** Methods for Porphyrin Precursors
*** Porphobilinogen
- Ehrlich's reagent
  - urobilinogen inhibition, therefore ion-exchange
*** 5-Aminolevulinic Acid
- Converted to Ehrlich's reacting pyrrole via condensation with
  acetylacetone
*** Analysis of Porphyrins in Urine and Feces
- Screening via spectrophotometric scanning of acidified urine or
  fecal extracts for the Soret band
*** Semiquantitative Method for Total Porphyrin in Urine and Feces
- we do this as a screen
*** HPLC Fractionation of Porphyrins in Urine and Feces
- fluormetric detection recommended

** Methods for Blood Porphyrins
*** Determination of Erythrocyte Total Porphyrin
- increased in:
  - EPP
  - CEP
  - homozygous variants
  - iron deficiency
  - hemolytic anemia
  - some other forms of anemia
  - lead poisoning
- total porphyrin concentration within RI excludes EPP
    - distinction between EPP and other causes requires diffentiation
      between protoporphyrin and ZN-protoporphyrin
*** Qualitative Determination of ZN-protoporphyrin and Protoporphyrin
- Emission peaks for ZPP = 587 nm and free protoporphyrin = 630 nm
- In EPP the concentration of free protoporphyrin >> ZPP
  - may be 60% of total porphyrin
- Lead poisoning, iron deficiency and other anemias ZPP is the main
  component.
- Limitation of method is that extraction of ZPP is ~50%

** Analysis of Plasma Porphyrins
*** Fluorescence emision Spectroscopy of Plasma Porphyrins
- Emission spectra of saline diluted plasma excited at 405 nm
- In VP the plasma contains porphyrin covalently bound to protein with
  E_max at 624 to 628 nm
- Other porphyrias contain porphyrin non-covalently bound to albumin
  and hemopexin.
  - Fresh plasma protoporphyrin E_max = 632 nm
  - Older sample: binding to globulin released from red cells E_max =
    626 nm
- 2\degree causes of increase include: impaired excretion, renal
  failure, cholestasis


* Enzyme Measurements
- rarely required for patients with symptoms
- can be used for family studies, DNA is better
** Assay of Etythrocyte Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase Activity
- Measures rate of formation of porphyrinogens from PBG by hemolysed erythrocytes
- Discriminates between AIP and unaffected relatives
- Interferences:
  - HMBS activity declines sharply with erythrocyte age
  - affected by \prop of retics, and young cells in peripheral blood
  - \uparrow in acute illness, ie acute porphyria
  - \sim 1:800 low HMBS activity in France
* DNA analysis
- required for
  1) family screening
  2) pattern of inheritance in EPP
  3) prognosis in CEP

- can be used in patients without current symptoms or biochemical
  Abnormalities
- sequencing and gene dosage analysis
