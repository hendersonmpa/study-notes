* Background
** The Urea Cycle
- Free ammonium ion, generated from the glutaminase and glutamate
  dehydrogenase reactions,
  - Condensed with bicabonate and converted to urea for excretion.
- All required enzymes are expressed in the periportal cells of the liver lobule.

*** Mitochondrial enzymes:
  - Carbamoylphosphate synthetase I (CPS1, AR)
    - rate-limiting reaction of the urea cycle
    - N-acetylglutamate is an obligate activator
  - N-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS, AR)
  - Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC, X-linked)
*** Cytoplasmic enzymes:
  - Argininosuccinic acid synthetase (ASS1, AR)
  - Argininosuccinic acid lyase (ASL, AR)
  - Arginase (ARG1, AR)

*** Transporters:
  - Ornithine translocase (SLC25A15, AR)

** The Urea Cycle: Ancillary Enzymes
- Carbonic Anhydrase Va (CAVA)
- Citrin (SLC25A13, AR)
- \Delta{}-pyrroline-5 carboxylate synthetase (P5CS)
  

** The Urea Cycle

** Biochemical Book Keeping
- Beginning and ending with ornithine, the reactions of the cycle
  consume three equivalents of ATP and a total of four high-energy
  nucleotide phosphates.
- Urea is the only new compound generated by the cycle; all other
  intermediates and reactants are recycled.
- The energy consumed in the production of urea is more than recovered
  by the release of energy formed during the synthesis of the urea
  cycle intermediates.
- Ammonia released during the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction is
  coupled to the formation of NADH. In addition, when fumarate is
  converted back to aspartate, the malate dehydrogenase reaction used
  to convert malate to oxaloacetate generates a mole of NADH.
- These two moles of NADH are subsequently oxidized in the mitochondria yielding six moles of ATP.

* NBS for UCDs
** NBS Challenges
- Biochemical 
  - Sensitivity of NBS methods and markers for the mitochondrial UCDs.
- Clinical 
  - Severely affected patients - very early onset of disease before NBS results are available
  - Patients with mild disease - pre-symptomatic detection of disease remains controversial

** Markers for NBS for Mitochondrial UCDs
- Measurement of ammonia is not feasible
  - post-collection elevation, no methods in lit
- Glutamine is another metabolite that is generally elevated in UCDs.
   - spontaneous glutamate and pyroglutamate formation.
- Orotic acid is often elevated in the urine of patients with
  OTC deficiency, cannot be used as a marker in blood.

** NBS for Mitochondrial UCDs
- Mitochondrial enzymes: NAGS, CPS1 and OTC

*** Biomarkers
- Low or decreased plasma levels of citrulline and arginine
- Urine orotic acid is often elevated in OTCD

** NBS for Cytoplasmic UCDs
- Cytoplasmic enzymes: ASS1, ASL, ARG1

*** Biomarkers
- ASSD: \uparrow citrulline
- ASLD: \uparrow argininosuccinate, \uparrow citrulline
- ARG1D: \uparrow arginine 

** Transporter Defects 
- Membrane bound transporters : ORNT1, Citrin 

*** Biomarkers
- Hyperammonemia-hyperornithinemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome (ORNT1): \uparrow ornithine
  - Ornithine not elevated in newborns
- Citrullinemia type II (Citrin): \uparrow citrulline

** NBS for UCDs in the US
- Current newborn screening panels in the United States using tandem
  mass spectrometry detect abnormal concentrations of analytes
  associated with ASS1 deficiency, and ASL deficiency in all states.

- Other disorders are screened for in some states only:
  - CPS1 deficiency is screened for in Florida, Maine, Massachusetts,
    Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and
    Vermont.
  - OTC deficiency is screened for in Connecticut, Maine,
    Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, and is
    likely to be detected in Kentucky and Utah.
  - Arginase deficiency is screened for in 35 states and likely to be
    detected in four more.
  - Citrin deficiency is screened for in 36 states and likely to be
    detected in 13 more.

** Newborn Screening for UCD: OTC
- The sensitivity and specificity of a low citrulline level as a
  marker for OTC deficiency in NBS has been questioned.
  - common causes of low citrulline in premature infants or in sick
    babies such as those with pathological conditions involving the
    small intestine, i.e. short-bowel syndrome
- The detection of OTC deficiency on NBS may be improved by using
  Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR) which includes
  glutamine, glutamate, and amino acid ratios in the analysis.

** Newborn Screening for UCD in Ontario
- Screen for ASA and ASL 
- Primary marker is citrulline
- Secondary markers are:
  - ASA
  - CIT/ORN
  - ASA/ARG

** Quantitative FIA-MS/MS 
- Amino acids in the DBS eluate are esterified as butyl esters with butanol-hydrogen chloride

- Citrulline contains a labile amino group that fragments together with butyl formate.

- Its name is derived from citrullus, the Latin word for watermelon, from which it was first isolated in 1914 by Koga and Odake. 

** Screening Thresholds
CIT \ge 70 OR \\
[CIT \ge 40 AND (ASAâ‰¥2.5 OR CIT/ARG\ge 6.61 OR CIT/ORN\ge 2.40 OR ASA/ORN\ge 0.10 OR ASA/ARG\ge 0.12)]

- Citrulline > 70 \micro{}mol/L is confirmed

- Citrulline > 100 \micro{}mol/L also prompt measurement of ASA

  - Daughter ions of 459 Da

* Clinical Challenges 
** Severe Mitochondrial UCDs
- First symptoms occur soon after birth between 12 and 72 h of age
- Although results were late, some patients still benefited from the
  availability of results shortly after presentation.

** Mild UCDs
- there are patients described with a late-onset of disease with only
  a single, few or even absence of symptom(s) and only a biochemical
  phenotype.
- case of ASSD, described as suffering from mild citrullinemia type 1,
  - a condition allelic to classical citrullinemia type 1 but much
    milder and with less, if any need for medical intervention.
- Such patients were often identified in neonatal screening programs
  and it has been discussed whether their mild phenotype would result
  from early detection and initiation of treatment or from a relevant
  residual enzyme or transporter function.
- Metabolites and/or mutation analysis may help to identify attenuated
  patients to avoid medicalization of non-diseases
