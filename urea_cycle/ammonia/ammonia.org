* Background
** Production
- Ammonia is produced via the metabolism of nitrogen containing compounds:
  - amino acids
  - purines and pyrimidines
- Intestinal bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea in the gut.
- Ammonia in the body of a healthy individual is typically present as ammonium ions.
  \ce{NH4+ <=>[pKa = 9.3] NH3 + H+}
- Ammonium ions cannot cross membranes

- periportal hepatocytes :: \uparrow capacity, \downarrow affinity
- perivenous hepatocytes :: \downarrow capacity, \uparrow affinity

- Figure [[fig:lobule]] focuses on periportal and perivenous
  hepatocytes as the two ammonia detoxifying compartments in
  liver.

- Ammonia is metabolized with high capacity but low affinity in
  the urea cycle which is solely expressed in periportal
  hepatocytes.

- As back-up, ammonia is detoxified by the action of glutamine
  synthetase that is solely expressed in perivenous hepatocytes and
  has a low capacity but high affinity towards ammonia. Urea and
  glutamine re-enter the circulation to be excreted in urine or
  further metabolized in the kidney, respectively.


* Laboratory
** Measurement at CHEO

- The VITROS AMON Slide has a multilayered analytical element coated
  on a polyester support.
- A drop of patient sample is deposited on the slide.
- An  alkaline buffer converts ammonium ions to gaseous ammonia. 
- A semipermeable membrane allows only ammonia to pass through
- After incubation the reflection density of the dye is measured.

\centering
\ce{NH3 + bromophenol blue -> blue dye (600 nm)}

- bromophenol blue changes from yellow at pH 3.0 to blue at pH 4.6

** Measurement at TOH
- The Dimension Vista Ammonia (AMM) method uses glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and a NADPH analog.

\centering
\ce{\alpha-ketoglutarate + NH4+ + NADPH ->[GLDH] L-glutamate + NADP+ + H2O}

- The decrease in absorbance due to the oxidation of the reduced
  cofactor is monitored at 340/700 nm and is proportional to the
  ammonia concentration.

** Ammonia Interpretation 
- In a healthy person, ammonia is relatively tightly controlled;

* Clinical
** Neonatal Symptoms
- poor feeding
- vomiting
- seizures
- respiratory distress
- poor peripheral blood circulation
- hypotonia
- vomiting
- "abnormal neurologic changes"
  - stupor
- inhibition of insulin secretion

*** Outcome
- outcome \propto $\frac{1}{duration + [\ce{NH4+}]}$
  - irreparable brain damage
** Causes of Hyperammonemia
*** Increased ammonia production
- High protein diets
- Massive hemolysis
- Parenteral nutrition with high nitrogen content
- Protein catabolism (kwashiorkor)
- Infection
- *Pre-analytical*

*** Decreased ammonia elimination
- liver disease
- IEM
  - urea cycle defects
  - fatty acid oxidation defects
  - organic acidemias

** Pre-analytical Considerations in Ammonia Testing
- Capillary ammonia is significantly higher than arterial and venous
  - Capillary samples - sweat contamination
- Delayed analysis
  - erythrocytes and platlets \to ammonia
  - GGT activity
  - Serum is unsuitable
- Hemolysis -  \uparrow [ammonia] RBC
- Detergent contamination

** Specimen Collection and Handling
- Free flowing venous or arterial sample
- Pre-chilled lithium heparin (green top)
- Transport on ice
- Separated w/in 15 min of collection
- Analysed immediately
- Once separated stable: 4 hr @ 4\textdegree C , 24hr @-20\textdegree C

** Biochemical Testing in Neonate with Hyperammonemia
- First line
  - Blood gas analysis
    - UCD \to Respiratory alkalosis
    - UCD rarely acidotic
    - Acidosis suggests OAD or mitochondrial disorder.
  - Urea
  - Glucose
    - hypoglycemia - FAOD, HI, liver failure
  - Liver Function tests
  - Lactate
    - mitochondrial disorders,organic acidemias and FAODs

- Specialist Investigations
  - Urine and Plasma amino acids
    - citruline
    - argininosuccinic acid
  - Urine Organic Acids
    - orotic acid

** Differential Diagnosis in the Neonate

- Inborn errors of metabolism are a very important part of the
  differential diagnosis in a neonate who has hyperammonemia
  - Ammonia 100 umol/L or higher

- Sepsis
- Liver dysfunction
- Portocaval shunt
- Perinatal asphyxia
- Sampling artifact
- IEMs
  - Urea cycle disorders
  - Organic acidemias
  - Fatty acid oxidation disorders
  - Mitochondrial disorders
  - Amino acid transporter deficiency
