#+TITLE: Diagnostic Testing for OTC Deficiency
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Henderson, PhD, FCACB
#+DATE: \today

* Background
** The Urea Cycle
*** Mitochondrial enzymes:
  - Carbamoylphosphate synthetase I (CPS1, AR)
    - rate-limiting reaction of the urea cycle
    - N-acetylglutamate is an obligate activator
  - N-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS, AR)
  - Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC, X-linked)
*** Cytoplasmic enzymes:
  - Argininosuccinic acid synthetase (ASS1, AR)
  - Argininosuccinic acid lyase (ASL, AR)
  - Arginase (ARG1, AR)

*** Transporters:
  - Ornithine translocase (SLC25A15, AR)

*** Ancillary Enzymes
- Carbonic Anhydrase Va (CA5A, AR)
- Citrin (SLC25A13, AR)
- \Delta{}-pyrroline-5 carboxylate synthetase (ALDH18A1)

** OTC Deficiency

  \ce{ornithine + carbamoyl phosphate ->[OTC] citrulline}

- Incidence 1:56,500
- X-linked inheritance 

** OTCD Neonatal Onset 
- Severe neonatal-onset disease in males (but rarely in females)
- Males with severe neonatal-onset OTCD are typically normal
  at birth
  - become symptomatic on day two to three of life.
- After successful treatment of neonatal hyperammonemic coma these
  infants can easily become hyperammonemic again despite appropriate
  treatment
  -  typically require liver transplant by age six months to improve quality of life. 

** OTCD Post-Neonatal Onset
- Post-neonatal-onset (partial deficiency) disease in males and females.
- Males and heterozygous females with post-neonatal-onset (partial)
  OTC deficiency can present from infancy to later childhood,
  adolescence, or adulthood.
- In all OTCD a hyperammonemic crisis can be precipitated by stress
- Typical neuropsychological complications include developmental delay, learning disabilities,
  intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
  (ADHD), and executive function deficits.

** OTCD Metabolic Derangements


- Hyperammonemia due to product inhibition of CPS by CP.
- Excess CP \to \uparrow pyrimidine biosysthesis
  - \uparrow orotic acid and uracil in urine
- \uparrow \ce{NH4+} \to \uparrow glutamine
  - \uparrow  glycine, serine, glutamate, alanine

*** Routine Biochemical Testing
- Routine Biochemical Testing
  - hyperammonemia
  - absence of hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, ketonuria

*** Plasma Amino Acids  
- Plasma Amino Acids
  - glutamine :: \gt 1000 \si{\micro\mol/\liter}
  - alanine :: \gt 600 \si{\micro\mol/\liter}
  - citruline :: \lt 10 \si{\micro\mol/\liter}
  - arginine :: \lt 30 \si{\micro\mol/\liter}
 
** Female Carriers of OTC
- Variable inactivation of the X-chromosome
- Variable phenotype
  - low residual OTC function
  - asymptomatic
  - long term symptoms consistent with undiagnosed hyperammonemia

* Case Study
** A Case of Severe Neonatal Hyperammonemia

- Roy W.A. Peake and Edward G. Neilan, Clin Chem 2017
  - Department of Laboratory Medicine and Division of Genetics and Metabolism
  - Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Boston, MA.
** Clinical History
- Male child delivered by C-section at 39 wks
- Emerged limp and cyanotic w/o respiratory effort
  - intubated, suctioned, positive pressure ventilation
  - developed spontaneous respiration
- Treated with boluses of saline and glucose for hypotension and hypoglycemia
- Thrombocytopenia was treated with empiric antibiotics

- Full enteral feeding by day 4

- Day 5 developed apnea and seizures

  - intubated, ventilation, phenobarbital, antibiotics

** Screening and Diagnostic Testing
- Newborn Screening results became available
  - "concerning for low-normal citrulline levels"
- A metabolic disorder was considered
- Plasma amino acids are useful for diagnosis for OTCD

*** Lab results
- Ammonia :: 2090 \si{\micro\mol/\liter} (RI < 90)
- Plasma Amino Acids
  - Glutamine :: 1536 \si{\micro\mol/\liter} (RI 330-1080)
  - Alanine :: 1160 \si{\micro\mol/\liter} (RI 120-500)
  - Citrulline :: 3 \si{\micro\mol/\liter} (RI 2-50)

** Urine Orotic Acid 
- OA is a surrogate marker for increased carbamoyl phosphate.
  - \uparrow CP overwhelms the pyrimidine synthesis pathway

\ce{CP ->[aspartate transcarbamylase] carbamoyl aspartate ->[dihydroorotase] dihydroorotate ->[dihydroorotate dehydrogenase] orotic acid}

- Qualitative urine organic acids have limited value in the diagnosis of UCDs.
- Methodological issues
  - OA is a charged molecule and is not efficiently extracted
  - OA often coelutes with cis-aconitic acid
    - Presence of OA ion pair 254 and 357 mz should be confirmed.

** Treatment
- IV sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate (ammonul)
  - phenylacetate + CoA + glutamine \to phenylactylglutamine
  - benzoate + CoA + glycine \to hippuric acid

- Emergency hemodialysis
- At day 7 ammonia was normal
  - veno-venous hemofiltration
  - ammonul and arginine

** Follow-up

- Molecular testing of OTC gene
  - hemizygous pathogenic variant (c.596A>G, p.Asn199Ser)
    - ornithine binding site
[[http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00480#showFeaturesViewer]]
  - previously reported in neonatal onset hyperammonemia
- At 9 months of age:
  - delayed by steady developmental progress
  - 1 episode of hyperammonemia ( 250 \si{\micro\mol/L)
- Liver transplant is being pursued

* Local Testing
** Urine Organic Acids
- Oximated with 10% hydroxylamine-HCL
  - avoids multiple TMS species due to keto-enol tautomerism
